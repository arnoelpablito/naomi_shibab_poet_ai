Before you know what kindness really is
you must lose things,
feel the future dissolve in a moment
like salt in a weakened broth.
What you held in your hand,
what you counted and carefully saved,
all this must go so you know
how desolate the landscape can be
between the regions of kindness.
How you ride and ride
thinking the bus will never stop,
the passengers eating maize and chicken
will stare out the window forever.
Before you learn the tender gravity of kindness
you must travel where the Indian in a white poncho
lies dead by the side of the road.
You must see how this could be you,
how he too was someone
who journeyed through the night with plans
and the simple breath that kept him alive.
Before you know kindness as the deepest thing inside,
you must know sorrow as the other deepest thing.
You must wake up with sorrow.
You must speak to it till your voice
catches the thread of all sorrows
and you see the size of the cloth.
Then it is only kindness that makes sense anymore,
only kindness that ties your shoes
and sends you out into the day to gaze at bread,
only kindness that raises its head
from the crowd of the world to say
It is I you have been looking for,
and then goes with you everywhere
like a shadow or a friend.

Wandering around the Albuquerque Airport Terminal, after learning
my flight had been delayed four hours, I heard an announcement:
"If anyone in the vicinity of Gate A-4 understands any Arabic, please
come to the gate immediately."
Well—one pauses these days. Gate A-4 was my own gate. I went there.
An older woman in full traditional Palestinian embroidered dress, just
like my grandma wore, was crumpled to the floor, wailing. "Help,"
said the flight agent. "Talk to her. What is her problem? We
told her the flight was going to be late and she did this."
I stooped to put my arm around the woman and spoke haltingly.
"Shu-dow-a, Shu-bid-uck Habibti? Stani schway, Min fadlick, Shu-bit-
se-wee?" The minute she heard any words she knew, however poorly
used, she stopped crying. She thought the flight had been cancelled
entirely. She needed to be in El Paso for major medical treatment the
next day. I said, "No, we're fine, you'll get there, just later, who is
picking you up? Let's call him."
We called her son, I spoke with him in English. I told him I would
stay with his mother till we got on the plane and ride next to
her. She talked to him. Then we called her other sons just
for the fun of it. Then we called my dad and he and she spoke for a while
in Arabic and found out of course they had ten shared friends. Then I
thought just for the heck of it why not call some Palestinian poets I know
and let them chat with her? This all took up two hours.
She was laughing a lot by then. Telling of her life, patting my knee,
answering questions. She had pulled a sack of homemade mamool
cookies—little powdered sugar crumbly mounds stuffed with dates and
nuts—from her bag—and was offering them to all the women at the gate.
To my amazement, not a single woman declined one. It was like a
sacrament. The traveler from Argentina, the mom from California, the
lovely woman from Laredo—we were all covered with the same powdered
sugar. And smiling. There is no better cookie.
And then the airline broke out free apple juice from huge coolers and two
little girls from our flight ran around serving it and they
were covered with powdered sugar, too. And I noticed my new best friend—
by now we were holding hands—had a potted plant poking out of her bag,
some medicinal thing, with green furry leaves. Such an old country tradi-
tion. Always carry a plant. Always stay rooted to somewhere.
And I looked around that gate of late and weary ones and I thought, This
is the world I want to live in. The shared world. Not a single person in that
gate—once the crying of confusion stopped—seemed apprehensive about
any other person. They took the cookies. I wanted to hug all those other women, too.
This can still happen anywhere. Not everything is lost.

It is difficult to know what to do with so much happiness.
With sadness there is something to rub against,
a wound to tend with lotion and cloth.
When the world falls in around you, you have pieces to pick up,
something to hold in your hands, like ticket stubs or change.
But happiness floats.
It doesn’t need you to hold it down.
It doesn’t need anything.
Happiness lands on the roof of the next house, singing,
and disappears when it wants to.
You are happy either way.
Even the fact that you once lived in a peaceful tree house
and now live over a quarry of noise and dust
cannot make you unhappy.
Everything has a life of its own,
it too could wake up filled with possibilities
of coffee cake and ripe peaches,
and love even the floor which needs to be swept,
the soiled linens and scratched records . . .
Since there is no place large enough
to contain so much happiness,
you shrug, you raise your hands, and it flows out of you
into everything you touch. You are not responsible.
You take no credit, as the night sky takes no credit
for the moon, but continues to hold it, and share it,
and in that way, be known.

A man crosses the street in rain,
stepping gently, looking two times north and south,
because his son is asleep on his shoulder.
No car must splash him.
No car drive too near to his shadow.
This man carries the world's most sensitive cargo
but he's not marked.
Nowhere does his jacket say FRAGILE,
HANDLE WITH CARE.
His ear fills up with breathing.
He hears the hum of a boy's dream
deep inside him.
We're not going to be able
to live in this world
if we're not willing to do what he's doing
with one another.
The road will only be wide.
The rain will never stop falling.

Even at this late date, sometimes I have to look up
the word "receive." I received his deep
and interested gaze.
A bean plant flourishes under the rain of sweet words.
Tell what you think—I'm listening.
The story ruffled its twenty leaves.
Once my teacher set me on a high stool
for laughing. She thought the eyes
of my classmates would whittle me to size.
But they said otherwise.
We'd laugh too if we knew how.
I pinned my gaze out the window
on a ripe line of sky.
That's where I was going.

Choose one word and say it over
and over, till it builds a fire inside your mouth.
Adhafera, the one who holds out, Alphard, solitary one,
the stars were named by people like us.
Each night they line up on the long path between worlds.
They nod and blink, no right or wrong
in their yellow eyes. Dirah, little house,
unfold your walls and take us in.
My well went dry, my grandfather’s grapes
have stopped singing. I stir the coals,
my babies cry. How will I teach them
they belong to the stars?
They build forts of white stone and say, “This is mine.”
How will I teach them to love Mizar, veil, cloak,
to know that behind it an ancient man
is fanning a flame?
He stirs the dark wind of our breath.
He says the veil will rise
till they see us shining, spreading like embers
on the blessed hills.
Well, I made that up. I’m not so sure about Mizar.
But I know we need to keep warm here on earth
And when your shawl is as thin as mine is, you tell stories.

Fifty years before you did your homework in Ferguson
we did our homework in Ferguson, thinking life was fair.
If we didn’t do our homework we might get a U—Unsatisfactory.
Your dad says you didn’t even get to see the rest of the world yet.
I’ve seen too much of the world and don’t know
how to absorb this—a girl shot through a wall—U! U! U!
I’d give you some of my years if I could—you should not
have died that night—there was absolutely no reason
for you to die. I’d like to be standing in a sprinkler with you,
the way we used to do, kids before air conditioning,
safe with our friends in the drenching of cool,
safe with our shrieks and summer shorts and happy hair,
where can we go without thinking of you now?
Did you know there was a time Ferguson was all a farm?
It fed St. Louis…giant meadows of corn, sweet potatoes,
laden blackberry bushes, perfect tomatoes in crates,
and everything was shovels and hoes, and each life,
even the little tendril of a vine, mattered,
and you did your homework and got an S for Satisfactory,
Super, instead of the S of Sorrow now stamped on our hands.

I don’t want to see
what spilled out,
blue clay jug of dreams
toppled at the head of his pallet
found at dawn,
every drop of future
gone.

remains all supple hands and gesture
skin of language
fusing its finest seam
in fluent light
with a raised finger
dance of lips
each sentence complete
he speaks to the shadow
of leaves
strung tissue paper
snipped into delicate flags
on which side of the conversation
did anyone begin?
wearing two skins
the brilliant question mark of Mexico
stands on its head
like an answer

The man with laughing eyes stopped smiling
to say, “Until you speak Arabic,
you will not understand pain.”
Something to do with the back of the head, 
an Arab carries sorrow in the back of the head,
that only language cracks, the thrum of stones
weeping, grating hinge on an old metal gate. 
“Once you know,” he whispered, “you can
enter the room
whenever you need to. Music you heard
from a distance,
the slapped drum of a stranger’s wedding,
well up inside your skin, inside rain, a thousand
pulsing tongues. You are changed.”
Outside, the snow has finally stopped. 
In a land where snow rarely falls,
we had felt our days grow white and still. 
I thought pain had no tongue. Or every tongue
at once, supreme translator, sieve. I admit my
shame. To live on the brink of Arabic, tugging
its rich threads without understanding 
how to weave the rug…I have no gift. 
The sound, but not the sense. 
I kept looking over his shoulder for someone else
to talk to, recalling my dying friend
who only scrawled 
I can’t write. What good would any grammar
have been
to her then? I touched his arm, held it hard,
which sometimes you don’t do in the Middle East,
and said, I’ll work on it, feeling sad
for his good strict heart, but later in the slick street
hailed a taxi by shouting Pain! and it stopped
in every language and opened its doors.

scurried around a classroom papered with poems.
Even the ceiling, pink and orange quilts of phrase…
they introduced one another, perched on a tiny stage
to read their work, blessed their teacher who
encouraged them to stretch, wouldn’t let their parents
attend the reading because parents might criticize,
believed in the third and fourth eyes, the eyes in
the undersides of leaves, the polar bears a thousand miles north,
and sprouts of grass under the snow. They knew their poems
were glorious, that second-graders could write better
than third or fourth, because of what happened
on down the road, the measuring sticks
that came out of nowhere, poking and channeling
the view, the way fences broke up winter,
or driveways separated the smooth white sheets
birds wrote on with their feet.

A very large spider
wove her fancy web
between the Don Juan rosebush
and the Queen’s Crown vine.
We greeted her every day
going in and out.
We had so many destinations
but she just swung there
in the air
in the day’s long stare
that grows so hot by four o’clock
we boycott the whole front yard.
By evening we’d be outside again
breathing jasmine
watering honeysuckle
plucking mint
and she’d be wrapping
her little flies and wasps
in sticky sacks.
The trolley rang its bell at us
and we waved back.
It was nice living with Rose.
Living our different lives
side by side.
One night wild thunder
shook the trees,
the sky crackled and split,
the winds blew hard
and by morning
Rose was gone.
Did she wash away?
Did she find a safer home?
She keeps spinning her elegant web
inside us
so long
so long
after the light made it shine.
Mystery
When I was two
I said to my mother
I don’t like you, but I like you.
She laughed a long time.
I will spend the rest of my life
trying to figure this out.
Ringing
A baby, I stood in my crib to hear
the dingy-ding of a vegetable truck approaching.
When I was bigger, my mom took me out
to the street
to meet the man who rang the bell and
he tossed me
a tangerine . . . the first thing I ever caught.
I thought he was
a magic man.
My mom said there used to be milk trucks too.
She said, Look hard, he’ll be gone soon.
And she was right. He disappeared.
Now, when I hear an ice-cream truck chiming
its bells, I fly.
Even if I’m not hungry—just to watch it pass.
Mailmen with their chime of dogs barking
up and down the street are magic too.
They are all bringers.
I want to be a bringer.
I want to drive a truck full of eggplants
down the smallest street.
I want to be someone making music
with my coming.
Toys on the Planet Earth
We need carved wooden cows, kites,
small dolls with flexible limbs.
I vote for the sponge in the shape of a sandwich.
Keep your bad news, world.
Dream of something better.
A triangle mobile spinning in the wind.
Furry monkeys hugging.
When my dad was small,
his only toy was an acorn and a stick.
That’s what he told me.
So he carved the acorn into a spinning top
and wrote in the dirt.
And that’s what made him
the man he is today.
Every Cat Has a Story
“British researchers found that a sheep can distinguish and recognize as
many as 50 other sheep’s faces for up to two years, even in silhouette.”
(NEWSPAPER REPORT)
The yellow cat from the bakery
smelled like a cream puff.
She followed us home.
We buried our faces
in her sweet fur.
One cat hid her head
when I practiced violin.
But she came out for piano.
At night she played sonatas on my quilt.
One cat built a nest in my socks.
One inhabited the windowsill
staring mournfully up the street all day
while I was at school.
One cat pressed the radio dial,
heard a voice come out, and smiled.
Visiting My Old Kindergarten Teacher, Last Day of
School
She’s packed the brown bear puppet
in the cupboard and distributed
the Self-Portraits with Hats.
I remember those.
She says, “You look just the same
but bigger! I would know you anywhere!”
I would know her too.
Someone’s crying.
He doesn’t like the little holes
in the corner of his painting
from hanging on display.
I help her gather stubs of crayons
from the table grooves.
Do the plans she made on the first day
seem far away
as pebbles dropped into a stream?
The ones whose names she calls in her sleep
gather rumpled papers into their bags,
hug her and fly.
It is a big wind blowing
after they all go home.
Worry
My mother’s braid
is wrapped in soft tissue
and stored in a shoebox
in the attic.
I don’t want to be
eighty years old
looking at that braid
all by myself.
The Boys
I played with the boys till I felt blurry.
Minicars, fast cars,
the model ship constructed with toothpicks and glue.
WHOOOOOOOOO-EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
(that was boring)
The boys went running into the field waving sticks!
The boys hit a fire hydrant with a stick and laughed!
Where Are You?
When I was small,
I called out through the house.
I’m here, said my mother and dad.
I’m here, said my brother,
and the bear on my bed
said it too.
In your bones
in your memory
trust me
I’m tucked inside each fresh paper page
you’ll write on.
Each hour you don’t see me, I’m still there.
How many things add up the same?
Your life, my life,
the bucket, the sea.
Ellipse
My father has a parenthesis
on either side of his mouth.
His new words
live inside his old words.
And there’s a strange semicolon
birthmark on my neck—
what does it mean,
my sentence is incomplete?
Please,
live with me in the open slope
of a question mark.
Don’t answer it!
Curl up in a comma
that says more, and more, and more . . .
Big Head, Big Face
(what my brother said to me)
If your head had been smaller
maybe you woulda had less thoughts in it,
maybe you wouldn’t have so many troubles.
This is just a guess but seems to me
like a little drawer only hold a few spoons
and you can always find the one you need
while a big drawer jammed with tongs
strings corks junky stuff receipts birthday cards
you never gonna look at
scrambled and mixed so one day
you
open that drawer
poke your hand in and big knife go
through your palm
you didn’t even know a knife was IN there,
well, that’s why I think
it might not be so bad to have a little head
with just a few thoughts few memories few hopes
maybe if only one little one came true
that be enough for you.
Supple Cord
My brother, in his small white bed,
held one end.
I tugged the other
to signal I was still awake.
We could have spoken,
could have sung
to one another,
we were in the same room
for five years,
but the soft cord
with its little frayed ends
connected us
in the dark,
gave comfort
even if we had been bickering
all day.
When he fell asleep first
and his end of the cord
dropped to the floor,
I missed him terribly,
though I could hear his even breath
and we had such long and separate lives
ahead.
Every Day
My hundred-year-old next-door neighbor told me:
every day is a good day if you have it.
I had to think about that a minute.
She said, Every day is a present
someone left at your birthday place at the table.
Trust me! It may not feel like that
but it’s true. When you’re my age
you’ll know. Twelve is a treasure.
And it’s up to you
to unwrap the package gently,
lift out the gleaming hours
wrapped in tissue,
don’t miss the bottom of the box.
The Bucket
A small girl with braids
is carrying a bucket
toward the sea.
She walks determinedly,
her red bathing suit
secure on her hips.
She seems to know
exactly what she is doing,
what she will carry
in the bucket.
Nothing can stop her,
not the sand,
which tries to swallow
each tiny foot,
or the mother,
calling after her
with a camera.
Now she is running,
waving her arms,
the small bucket
thrown free
into the air!
Little Chair
“There’s a cool web of language winds us in. . . .”
—ROBERT GRAVES
“I saw great things mirrored in littleness. . . .”
—EDITH SITWELL

I didn’t mind so much
growing out of little girl clothes
the blue striped shirt
the corduroy jumper
giving up Candy Land
and my doctor’s kit
but never again to fit
the turquoise Mexican chair
with flowers painted on it
hurt
I keep it in my room till now
a throne for the stuffed camel
Little kids sit on it when they visit
The straw in the seat is still strong
The flowers are always blooming

Miss Ruth Livingston
who taught first grade for forty-three years
in Marfa, Texas
kept a little reading chair
in front of the windows in her classroom
Whenever her students finished their work
they knew they could go over to the little chair
and read
It was a safe place
Their minds could wander anywhere
I wish everyone in the world had a little chair

Recently a big cowboy wearing sunglasses
came to Miss Livingston’s house and asked where
“that old furniture from our classroom went”
She’s ninety-seven now
She still has her china-faced dolls
from when she was small
She pointed at the wooden reading chair
sitting in front of the windows
in her beautiful living room
He walked over to the little chair
with his hands folded
and silently stood there, stood there
Secret Hum
Secret
How can I be in love with a bus
going by at 6 A.M.
when no one I know is riding it?
Swoosh of tires in the rain—
the hummingbird in the zinnia patch
doesn’t find a single flower worth
sinking her beak into.
She’s a choosy hummingbird!
I’m a choosy hummingbird
All day I dip and dive
twice as alive
as yesterday.
Some Days
Your handwriting stands
like a small forest on the page
You could enter it anywhere
Your room looks new to you
maybe you moved a lamp
arranged a pillow differently
on the bed
Such small things
change a room
Single candle
on a desk you finally cleaned
sharpened pencils waiting
in a white cup
I devote myself to short sentences
Air answers
Breath remembers
A streak of light signs the floor
Eye
I am keeping my eye on that boy.
My secret eye, spy eye.
How does he act when the teacher
leaves the room?
If someone makes a mistake,
what then?
He picked up Lucy’s pencil when she dropped it.
Does he recognize my existence?
Does he see me gleaming
in my chair?
I Want to Meet the Girl
who does not run her country
the way I do not run my country.
I want to meet the girl
who hides in a crowd,
who laughs into her hand,
who was not in the picture.
The girl who stands back
after being introduced
by her parents
in a way she would not choose.
Who turns her head to the side
so she doesn’t miss seeing what’s there.
Where is she?
In the School Cafeteria
Your face makes me feel like a lighthouse
beaming across waves.
We don’t even know one another,
yet each day I am looking for your face.
Walking slowly among tables, I balance my tray,
glancing to the side.
You’re not here today.
Are you sick?
Why are you absent?
And why, among all these faces,
is there only one I want to see?
Whatever the reason
your absence is not excused
by me.
Crush
A girl wrote a letter on an orange
and placed it on a doorstep.
That day the sky tasted fresh as mint.
Where He Is
Last night at sunset
two jet trails made a giant X in the sky
right over our city.
I was reading Spanish in the porch swing
when my neighbor walking her two dogs
pointed up, shouting happily,
“X marks the spot! YOU ARE HERE!”
White trails against dusky blue.
I stared at her. I said, “You are here too.
We are all here.”
And I got goose bumps.
Because I knew the boy I haven’t met yet
is here too, somewhere close by,
and I knew he was looking up.
I could feel him looking.
Groups of People Going Places Together
One is always walking
in front of the others.
Maybe this is the one
who really wanted to come.
They didn’t all want to come,
that’s for sure.
Someone is pushing a baby carriage.
The baby is sleeping, sunburned,
or fussy.
Maybe the baby didn’t want to come.
The baby would rather be
crawling around on a rug.
That girl would rather be home reading.
Very little conversation
is going on.
Maybe two people tipping their heads together
asking why they came.
No one smiles at me or anyone else going by.
They are clumsy, carrying towels, jugs,
beach bags, hats.
It is hard to walk in a group.
Sifter
When our English teacher gave
our first writing invitation of the year,
Become a kitchen implement
in 2 descriptive paragraphs, I did not think
butcher knife or frying pan,
I thought immediately
of soft flour showering through the little holes
of the sifter and the sifter’s pleasing circular
swishing sound, and wrote it down.
Rhoda became a teaspoon,
Roberto a funnel,
Jim a muffin tin
and Forrest a soup pot.
We read our paragraphs out loud.
Abby was a blender. Everyone laughed
and acted giddy but the more we thought about it,
we were all everything in the whole kitchen,
drawers and drainers,
singing teapot and grapefruit spoon
with serrated edges, we were all the
empty cup, the tray.
This, said our teacher, is the beauty of metaphor.
It opens doors.
What I could not know then
was how being a sifter
would help me all year long.
When bad days came
I would close my eyes and feel them passing
through the tiny holes.
When good days came
I would try to contain them gently
the way flour remains
in the sifter until you turn the handle.
Time, time. I was a sweet sifter in time
and no one ever knew.
I Said to Dana’s Mother
I can’t wait to be older and free.
We were sitting at Dana’s kitchen table,
working on our history project.
Free of schoolwork, able to choose
the ways I spend my days,
but Dana’s mom turned her face
to me sharply.
“Missy,” she said (not my name),
“you’ll never be as free
as you are now.”
Then she turned back to
cooking dinner.
The air felt thinner in the room.
Thinner, and sad.
Can air feel sad?
Because of Poems
Words have secret parties.
Verbs, adjectives, and nouns
meet outside their usual boundaries,
wearing hats.
MOODY feels doubtful about attending
and pauses near the door, ready to escape.
But she’s fascinated by DAZZLE.
BEFRIEND throws a comforting arm
around her shoulder.
LOST and REMEMBER huddle
in the same corner, trading
phone numbers.
I serve punch.
Having Forgotten to Bring a Book, She Reads the
Car Manual Aloud
Do not sit on the edge of the open moonroof.
Do not operate the moonroof if falling snow
has caused it to freeze shut.
(I thought it was a sunroof, actually.)
Do not place coins into the accessory socket.
The cup holder should not be used while driving.
Well, when then?
While parked at home?
Perhaps at midnight, with insomnia?
Hi, Mom, I think I’ll just go have a glass of milk
in the driveway.
If you need to dispose of the air bag
or scrap the vehicle . . .
Never allow anyone to ride in the luggage area.
Do not operate the defogger longer than necessary.
Please remove necktie or scarf while working on
engine.
Never jack up the vehicle more than necessary.
A running engine can be dangerous.
If the Shoe Doesn’t Fit

On the Same Day My Parents Were Arguing
Down by the quiet little river
between the old missions,
white cranes stand listening.
It is hard to tell if they are awake.
Their elegant necks barely turn
as another crane floats low
among them, touching ground.
One dips a beak swiftly into water
then springs back.
What have they seen across the long sky?
It hides inside the layered feathers
of their heads.
Changed
They said something mean about me
and didn’t notice it was mean.
So my heart wandered
into the rainy night without them
and found a canopy
to hide under.
My eyes started
seeing through things.
Like gauze.
Old self through new self.
My flexible body
went backwards
and forwards
in time.
It’s hard to describe but true:
I grew another head
with better ideas
inside my old head.
Hairdo
Because of the hair on the head
of the girl in front of me in school,
daily I travel slopes and curves.
I detour past the ribbon.
The clip is a dam.
I want to pluck it out—
surprise!
Inventing new methods for parting
on a blue-lined page, I make
math go away.
Embrace the math of hair.
Layers and levels of hair.
Some hair grows into ropes.
Rivers of waves, blunt cut.
Oh what will I make of my messy messy hair?
Message in the Thin Wind Before Bedtime
Stiff lip won’t help.
Stiff arm breaks too.
You need soft touch.
Try on soft shoe.
Hard voice cracks back.
Hard head heats up.
Mark that sharp note.
Bypass “So what?”
Tender heart lasts long.
Who looked? Who heard?
Let those grips go.
Birds get last word.
High Hopes
It wasn’t that they were so
high, exactly,
they were more
low-down,
close-to-the-ground,
I could rub them
the way you touch a cat
that rubs against your ankles
even if he isn’t yours.
So yes I feel lonely without them.
Now that I know the truth,
that I only dreamed someone liked me,
the cat has curled up in a bed of leaves
against the house and I still have to do
everything I had to do before
without a secret hum
inside.
Bad Dream
None of the cats
will let me touch them
I bring clean bowls
of fresh milk
They won’t drink it
till I’m back in the house
Tuxedo cat looks up
I’m at the window
Flick! He ran
into the bushes
Is this what it feels like
to grow older and return to
the neighborhood
you once knew?
Magical Geography
People I Admire
poke their shovels into the dirt.
Whatever they turn over interests them,
not just what they plant.
If there are roots or worms,
if the soil is darker, or mottled,
maybe the cap of an old bottle,
a snail, an ancient tunnel
left by a burrowing mole.
They know there is plenty of ground.
Every place has a warm old name.
The plumed grasses bend backwards
in the breeze, their job in life,
and they are proud of it.
My Body Is a Mystery
My body is a mystery
a magical geography of skin
It keeps me in
And I travel in it everywhere
sometimes it seems to beat me there
and then we meet again
Oh my eyes are the windows
and my face is the sky
And my legs are the trees that hold me
My hands are the branches and my head is a box
and I spend my lifetime picking locks
My body is a symphony
a tuba and a piccolo and drum
I hear some drum
And it sometimes seems to beat so low
And other times it makes me want to run
and then I have to run
Oh my blood is the music
and my voice finds the notes
And my lungs are conductors singing One! Two!
And I sometimes lose the melody but I
never lose the dream
of the songs that might come through
Because my body is a mystery
a magical geography of skin
that keeps me in
And I travel in it everywhere
sometimes it seems to beat me there and then
We meet again
Oh we always meet again
Feeling Wise
A lady was quoted in the newspaper.
“It is not so hard to feel wise.
Just think of something dumb you could say,
then don’t say it.”
I like her.
I would take her gingerbread
if I knew where her house was.
Julia Child the famous chef said,
“I never feel lonely in the kitchen.
Food is very friendly.
Just looking at a potato, I like
to pat it.”
Staring down
makes you feel tall.
Staring into someone else’s eyes
makes you feel not alone.
Staring out the window during school,
you become the future,
smooth and large.
Sometimes I Pretend
I’m not me,
I only work for me.
This feels like
a secret motor
chirring inside my pocket.
I think, She will be so glad
when she sees the homework
neatly written.
She will be relieved
someone sharpened pencils,
folded clothes.
Poor Monday
At the stoplight
faces in the next window
are plaster-cast ceramics,
blank, unoriginal.
At school my friends drag in glumly.
Our teacher says, “What can you expect?
It’s Monday.”
So what?!
I’m Naomi!
You’re Rosa Lee!
Watermelon Truck
Today a truck heaped with watermelons
at the corner—
fat, stacked bodies
striped like animals
The sign said “75 cents and up”
An old man shaded his head with a newspaper
“And up”—the great American twist
You know he meant one midget for 75
The other hundred, $3.50
Margaret
May I describe the contents
of my grandmother’s kitchen
in Nova Scotia in 1949?
Grinding mill, butter churn,
hand-hemmed white cotton towels,
pale purple swatch of linen
spread diagonally
across a scarred wooden table
where Grandmother
kneaded and stirred.
A platter rimmed with violets,
some of the petals rubbed away.
And the crock of wooden spoons, of course,
the giant matches in a box . . .
There was something in the oven, always,
a streak of patience in the air.
My Sad Aunt
She sits in the living room,
mad at my parents
because they won’t let her
smoke in the house.
Maybe it’s not always easy
having a good imagination.
It follows you around
till you’re not sure who that is,
sitting in the living room.
She remembers a dream
that didn’t come true.
A riverbed
with no water in it.
Who did she want to be
when she was younger?
The List
A man told me he had calculated
the exact number of books
he would be able to read before he died
by figuring the average number
of books he read per month
and his probable earth span,
(averaging how long
his dad and grandpa had lived,
adding on a few years since he
exercised more than they did).
Then he made a list of necessary books,
nonfiction mostly, history, philosophy,
fiction and poetry from different time periods
so there wouldn’t be large gaps in his mind.
He had given up frivolous reading entirely.
There are only so many days.
Oh I felt sad to hear such an organized plan.
What about the books that aren’t written yet,
the books his friends might recommend
that aren’t on the list,
the yummy magazine that might fall
into his view at a silly moment after all?
What about the mystery search
through delectable library shelves?
I felt the heartbeat of forgotten precious books
calling for his hand.
You’re Welcome!
Where has courtesy gone?
(MY GRANDMOTHER’S CHANT)
People who don’t say “Thank you”
are a mysterious tribe.
Who do they think
they are?
People who say “No problem”
instead of “You’re welcome”
have a problem they don’t even
know about.
Moving House
A whole house traveled
down Broadway yesterday.
An old-fashioned white house
with green trim . . .
traffic stopped
so the house on wheels could pass.
You could almost hear
the lost family laughing,
clink of dishes,
swish of a screen door
in summer heat.
I wanted to follow the house,
to see where its new landing place would be,
but we were on a shopping trip
(faucets, tile, sinks)
for our very stationary house
that hasn’t gone anywhere
in a hundred years.
Actually, my mom and I were tired,
wishing we didn’t have to shop.
Seeing the moving house
changed us.
Everything felt easy after that.
Making a Mosaic
Some people begin at the center,
others at the outer edge,
pressing down chips
of lovely broken plates and cups.
Is this the story of days?
Arranged, glued down,
without much space between.
Here is the blue flowery fragment
from dinnerware
on a ship
that sank in 1780.
The antique green plate
Louise gave me
when I finished fifth grade.
Side by side,
a nice time, a terrible time.
It’s a messy job,
glue stuck to fingertips.
You keep standing back
to see a pattern
emerge.
Necklace
I hope Sunday’s slow and long,
steeped like a pot of mint tea.
Soft sun and deep thinking.
Saturday was a crowded calendar page,
a mound of chores.
Could Monday be a porch?
Facing the week.
Wednesday a meadow?
Thursday, let’s leave
small baskets at everyone’s door.
Flowers, notes, stones.
No one does that anymore.
Could a week be strung on a silver chain?
A boat?
A tree?
Tuesday as a tree?
From Labrador, 1800s
“If you wish to know who I am, I am old Lydia Campbell, formerly Brooks,
then Blake, after Blake now Campbell. So, you see, ups and downs has been
my life all through. And now I am what I am . . .” (A CANADIAN ORAL
HISTORY)
We are who we are.
Lydia, we send you light
from far away.
We send you green from a warm place.
You who knew the ice and cold,
who grew old inside your many names,
what were you like
before it all happened?
What did you hope
and where would you have
wandered?
Did you ride on a sled pulled by dogs?
When you stared into the swirl
of green northern lights in a midnight sky,
did you think those icy fingers
were pointing at you,
did you whisper, “Hi there,”
feeling the little hairs
on your skin
stand straight up?
Sweet Dreams Please
Historical Marker
out here in the land of wind
little purple flowers
where people once fought
it’s hard to imagine
people finding one another
in this huge space
and having something to fight about
Baby-sitting Should Not Be Called
sitting. Because it is chasing, bending,
picking up, and major play.
It is helping Wiley throw eight basketballs
into a green wheelbarrow and getting them out
again and doing this one hundred
times. Then he sits on the second step
to roll basketballs off the edge.
He waves at me to give them back.
Then he pitches pecans
at the tree trunk and wants me
to retrieve them.
They are small and
hide in the leaves.
But he knows if I find the right one.
Also he wants me to climb the ladder
(only to the third step)
holding him under one arm
so he can poke the fat basketball
through the lowered hoop.
Sitting? That’s a joke.
He wraps the baby doll
in a piece of green tissue paper
and eats Cheerios at the same time.
No! He doesn’t want me to
give the baby doll a Cheerio!
He wants to roll cars into
a parking lot in the corner
and speed them over my feet.
Wiley helps me remember
where I came from. I love him for
more than one reason.
I love his clean purpose,
his careful eye.
His pure glee when the pecan hits hard
and bounces off.
I love baby-sitting
even though I have to sleep
stretched out flat
like the monkey without stuffing
afterwards.
Abandoned Homestead, Big Bend National Park
Gilberto Luna and his wife
raised nine children
in this stone house
off the gravel canyon road.
They grew corn and peppers
between the dry lips of the desert.
Did his children ever fight?
What did they dream of,
so far from any city or train?
I think they dreamed of a fossil
full of clouds.
Gilberto lived to be extremely old.
Deserts will do that.
What about his wife?
The walls tipped in soon after they died.
Houses miss their people too.
A hundred years later, thin slits of light
sneak into three crooked rooms.
Turtle
Tonight I read a newspaper story
about a turtle found in Virginia
key on a key chain
looped through a hole in his shell
a number engraved on the key
the man who found him called the number
far away in Pennsylvania
learned that turtle was let loose twenty years before
Ho!
Think about it:
all these years of our lives,
he’s been walking.
Little Blanco River
You’re only a foot deep
under green water
your smooth shale skull
is slick & cool
blue dragonfly
skims you
like a stone
skipping
skipping
it never goes under
you square-dance with boulders
make a clean swishing sound
centuries of skirts
lifting & falling in delicate rounds
no one makes a state park out of you
you’re not deep enough
little blanco river
don’t ever get too big
The Bird Pose
For two months I examined
the photo in my mom’s yoga book.
It looked so easy,
balancing your knees
on your elbows.
But mine kept collapsing
like portable chairs.
My mom said, Remember, you
have to start slow.
How slow is slow? I said.
This feels slow to me.
Nothing helped so I threw the book
back on my mom’s bed.
What a dumb thing I tried to do.
That night I dreamed I flew.
Meteor Watch
Leaving the car on a high hill in the dark,
we spread a tablecloth on the ground
and eat with our fingers—
grapes, gingersnaps, cheese—
staring at the huge sky.
This night feels ripe.
What will flash by?
We want stars to surprise us.
We want to be
amazed.
Each streak of light, we cry out.
If you turn your head
for just a minute, you can miss one.
Focus on east,
you lose the ones in the west.
I think of people knowing one another
in the great spaces,
the brave arc of connection
between friends, lit up.
And all the quiet stars
holding their places in between.
Writing in a Silo
I used to translate what a hen said.
Little kids believed me.
I looked deep into a cat’s eyes
to speak her language.
Memory is a silo
—what’s stocked
up?—
Corn or sorrow?
Crumbs of wheat
speckled hope?
1 door
2 windows
is this
a blossom
or a day?
What would I dream if I slept in a silo?
Standing by the train track
I wrote something different
than I might write
in a library.
When I sat by the river
my words became brown ducks
dipping their heads.
Finding a Pink Ribbon on the Wilderness Trail
We went hiking on the edge of town,
saw three deer, an armadillo
with coarse hairs on his belly when
my dad turned him over.
He snorted like a little pig.
Golden eagles flew huge circles
around their nests.
Then I found a lost ribbon on the trail,
the kind I would be sad to lose,
satiny smooth, with no rips
or blemishes.
I picked it up and put it in my pocket.
Later I worried.
What if the girl who lost it came back
looking for it?
We are tied by a trail,
tied by a ribbon.
I hope someone nice
finds the things I lose.
Bird in Hand
She was trying to show
the baby bird to her older sister
but the big girl said, “Yeccccch!
Put it down!”
The smaller girl kept holding it out,
shielding it from sun
with her other hand
and the big girl shouted, “I told you,
get rid of it!”
—squirting water
from a plastic bottle
on her sister and the bird.
The face of the younger girl,
stunned in the courthouse square.
Pressed-in pair of wings.
Scared heart pounding.
The Word PEACE
We could find words or parts of words
inside other words, it was always a game.
PEACE for example contained the crucial vowels of
EAT and EASY. If people ATE together
they would be less likely to KILL one another
especially if one were responsible for
shopping & cooking
& the other for serving & cleaning
& you took turns.
Then you started thinking, What does he like?
What might suit his fancy?
There should of course be meals
at all peace talks,
as there is eating at festivals & birthdays,
the generous platter, the giant bowl.
Those who placed a minor faith in rhyme,
might try PEACE & CEASE, as in,
could you please CEASE this hideous
waste of time & resources, world?
Had some people forgotten
just how lucky we are
to be BORN? People had grown too far
from the source, that’s for sure.
A man said ETHICS as if it were
a dirty word.
And what about apologizing to kids?
After TEACHing us to use words to solve
our differences, what did adults do?
People two years old were starting to look
a lot better than anyone else
& consider their vocabularies.
EAT was probably in there.
Sweet DREAMS & PLEASE which also contained
those crucial vowels found in PEACE
if anyone were still thinking about it.
This didn’t always work though,
because some might say WAR contained
the first two letters of ART
& you would not want them
for one minute to believe that.
To the Tree Frogs Outside the Window
Tree frogs, we were born wrong.
Why didn’t we get a song like you?
Something we could all sing together?
In the big dark, strumming our throats?
All night, branches alive outside our screens,
you paddle the long boat,
nothing could sink
on a note like yours.
I’d press myself against that twisty bark,
be part of the leaves.
I’d shrink, stretch free
of these heavy syllables,
curving perfectly into chorus,
something we could all sing
together, yes
Messages from Everywhere
light up our backyard.
A bird that flew five thousand miles
is trilling six bright notes.
This bird flew over mountains and valleys
and tiny dolls and pencils
of children I will never see.
Because this bird is singing to me,
I belong to the wide wind,
the people far away who share
the air and the clouds.
Together we are looking up
into all we do not own
and we are listening.
Something True
Day After Halloween, Jack-o’-Lantern Candle All
Burned Out
at dawn
on the sidewalk
a single shiny crow
pecking the stringy heart of a
pumpkin
exactly the same color as
sky
What Travel Does
My uncle comes home from Siberia
describing the smoked caribou leg
still wearing its hoof
left on the drainboard
week after week,
small knives slicing
sour red flesh.
He becomes a vegetarian.
But he misses the spaciousness.
It wasn’t crowded up there.
He ran into a polar bear
the same way you might run into your
mailman around the block.
My teacher returns from China
obsessed by the two-string violin
and the tiny birds in lattice cages.
She plays a tape
as we do our silent reading.
My whole family comes back from Paris
asking why we live anywhere else.
Every interesting person
and tucked neck scarf
looked full of stories.
People paused for peach tarts and crepes
in the middle of the afternoon.
My grandfather comes home
from Palestine
older.
He has been in the camps.
He can’t stop aching.
After Mexico, my neighbor Lupe
misses intense color,
won’t wear beige anymore.
She prefers papayas sliced
with lime juice drizzled on top.
She feels happy every time she faces south.
Abandoned Post Office, Big Bend
Forty years ago this postal window
far far far from any city
closed for good.
Where did everyone go?
Wooden cubbyholes
bear family names:
Wilson, Gibbs, Ramirez, Talley.
Someone has mailed them
dust.
Puff of wind
special delivery
and a little smoke rises.
Hello?
How much hope
how many thin slivers
long whistles
linen envelopes
found you here?
Did you ever go a year
without mail?
Beyond us every direction
desert mountains sky
write letters back and forth all day.
Tarantula scribbles a stone.
Fat-tailed fox signs with a flourish.
People aren’t your kind anymore:
Wilson, Gibbs, Ramirez, Talley.
We’re not that tough.
We have a car and bottles of water.
Each other’s voices holding us up.
Learning to Talk
In some places
you can feel
perfect bird-lit air
with human talk nudged up against.
Talk and the velvet drapery of silence.
Deep evening echoes stitched by doves.
That’s how I want to talk.
Not chatter chatter chatter.
Well, sometimes chatter chatter chatter
but also solid as adobe without cracks.
Also, water in the well.
Listen listen listen.
Hard to put together the pink hems
of sunrise and sunset
and the talkers on TV.
People beat talk into a froth.
Whip it up like a beverage.
We not only say
but say we’re going to say
and say we said.
O kiss the silent ground!
The cool place under the bummiest cactus!
There was a cat with no tail
darted out from behind a yucca this morning
little gray sparrow snagged in his teeth
shamelessly doing what he was born to do
and NOT ONE WORD.
Over the Weather
We forget about the spaciousness above the clouds
but
it’s up there.
The sun’s up there too.
When words we hear don’t fit the day,
when we worry
what we did or didn’t do,
what if we close our eyes,
say any word we love
that makes us feel calm,
slip it into the atmosphere
and rise?
Creamy miles of quiet.
Giant swoop of blue.
On the Sunset Limited Train
In the dining car, the couple from New Jersey
pressed their faces to the windows, anxious
for what they had waited all their lives to see,
the Pecos River and its high, brave bridge.
Good thing it is light, my dad said.
The sun had just risen.
When did you first start thinking about it?
So long ago! They stared at one another, shining.
West of the Pecos, such wonderful words!
Because that is the wild true land
beginning from there,
from the tall cliffs and the green river gash,
unfolding west, the land is stronger than anything,
it is the old song of land and air
we have never gotten to sing.
And we who had seen it many times
faced the glorious window
filled with the breaking light of day.
Across the Aisle
The little girl
with a floppy purple hair ribbon
coughed her way
across the Atlantic.
She coughed every 30 seconds
for seven whole hours.
No wonder she was fussy
before the plane took off,
pulling her father’s pant leg,
and whining.
Something had gotten into her,
a whale trapped in her tiny lungs,
a restless pressing dolphin,
and she would be tied into a seat
for hours while it tried to get out.
She never once covered her mouth.
I felt angry at her father and mother
who seemed not to have discovered
cough syrup, cough drops,
or hot tea with lemon and honey.
38,000 feet below us
waves were roiling up
from a deep darkness in the sea
and fish who do not mind the cold
were gliding around in secrecy.
Mona’s Taco
Dear Mona, do you know
how your old stucco building
marks the spot of Something True?
Your hand-lettered red sign rises up
like a crooked, friendly flag.
I can guess the menu:
bean & cheese, potato & egg,
maybe a specialty of your own making,
avocado twist or smoky salsa.
Your nombre is nice.
One taco might be enough.
You feed the ranchers who just lived through
the worst drought and flood back-to-back.
They touch the brims of their hats
when they see you.
Don’t we all need someone to greet us
to make us feel alive?
West of town, soft fields
ease our city-cluttered eyes.
There’s a rim of hills to hope for up ahead.
Mona, mysterious Mona,
I don’t have to eat with you to love you.
Every morning I think, Mona’s up.
A Way Around
Argument
is a room I won’t enter.
Some of us
would circle a whole house
not to enter it.
If you want to talk like that,
try a tree.
A tree is patient.
Don’t try me.
To My Texas Handbook
Don’t ever say
there’s nothing to see
in Ruidosa.
That’s mean.
If you are really Texas
or Minnesota or North Dakota
or Georgia or Ohio
you should know
there’s something strong to see
everywhere.
Over
and out.
Thoughts That Came in Floating
The land waits for rain to write on it.
Pool of birdseed, ring around the moon.
Night, that beautiful dark broom,
sweeps the day away.
But people are still fighting.
Far off, where we can’t see or hear them.
We can barely imagine
our own familiar neighborhoods
blowing up—poof!
Everything being broken or gone.
So dumb!
No kid in the world wakes up hoping
people will fight around her house
or inside it either.
Electric networks
under the thin skin of hours,
ticking, stretching…
Two jackrabbits pause
in the long grasses of the orchard
side by side…
I want to talk truly as a rooster . . .
Hide inside a pocket of days . . .
My mind
is always
open.
I don’t think
there’s even
a door.
She writes to me—
I can’t sleep because I’m seventeen
Sometimes I lie awake thinking
I didn’t even clean my room yet
And soon I will be twenty-five
And a failure
And when I am fifty—oh!
I write her back
Slowly
slow
Clean one drawer
Arrange words on a page
Let them find one another
Find you
Trust they might know something
You aren’t living
the whole thing
At once
That’s what a minute
said to an hour
Without me
you are nothing
Aurora Borealis
(Fairbanks, Alaska)
The light was speaking to me
stretching out its long gleaming fingers
pointing down
maybe it could hear my shout
shimmering green parentheses

my place was low

Big Bend National Park
Says No to All Walls
Big Bend has been here, been here.
Shouldn’t it have a say?
Call the mountains a wall if you must,
(the river has never been a wall),
leavened air soaking equally into all,
could this be the home
we ache for? Silent light bathing cliff faces,
dunes altering
in darkness, stones speaking low to one another,
border secrets,
notes so rooted you may never be lonely
the same ways again.
Big bend in thinking—why did you dream
you needed so much?
Water, one small pack. Once I lay on my back
on a concrete table
the whole day and read a book.
A whole book and it was long.
The day I continue to feast on.
Stones sifting a gospel of patience and dust,
no one exalted beyond a perfect parched cliff,
no one waiting for anything you do or don’t do.
Santa Elena, South Rim, once a woman here knew
what everything was named for. Hallie Stillwell,
brimming with stories, her hat still snaps in the wind.
You will not find a prime minister in Big Bend,
a president or even a candidate, beyond the lion,
the javelina, the eagle lighting on its nest.
Time’s Low Note
When the giant moon
rises over the river,
the cat stretches,
presses himself to the window,
croons.
He needs to go outside
into dark grass
to feel the mystery
combing his fur.
The wind never says
Call me back,
I’ll be waiting for your call.
All we know about wind’s address is
somewhere else.
A peony has been trying
to get through to you
When’s the last time
you really looked at one?
Billowing pinkish whitish petals
lushly layered
Might be the prime object of the universe
Peonies
in a house
profoundly uplift
the house
never say no
to peonies
Some days
reviewing everything
from brain’s balcony
filigree of thinking
a calm comes in
you can’t fix the whole street
change the city
or the world
but clearing bits of rubbish possible
moving one stone
Bully
One boy in our grade school was considered
a bully—
muttering rude insults under his breath,
tripping girls as they walked to their desks.
He bothered everyone equally, shook his shaggy
blond hair when teachers called his name.
My mom, hearing the tales, decided he was lonely
(no one ever played with him—in those days
bullies weren’t popular)
and committed me to attending
a children’s Christmas party with him
in the basement of a Methodist church.
Somehow she arranged this plan with his mother
as they waited for us by the schoolyard.
Impressive he had a mother who waited—
he seemed like a person who sprang from a forest,
growling.
My parents argued about the Christmas party
every night before it happened.
Daddy said Mom was “sacrificing me to her idealism.”
He kept calling it my “first date.”
I was only interested in what people did
in basements of churches
and what I would wear and would there be cake.
Since we ate no sugar at our house (idealism),
I dreamed of meeting sweets everywhere else.
The night of the party, Bully wore a suit
and striped tie. He didn’t growl.
It was his church, but he didn’t seem to know anyone.
I stood in my puffed pink icing of a ruffled dress
by the cake table and watched him. He skulked around
while the choir sang Christmas songs,
looked embarrassed when Santa appeared.
I talked to him any time he came near.
Would you like some cake? I don’t recall him
bothering me again at school for the rest of our years.
Invocation
She wanted to be a window wherever she walked.
Light of beauty might shine through,
but also she felt the small animal cry—“trapped.”
Someone else directing what to do.
Maybe trucks roaring past in the rain
held a clue in the spin of their wheels.
We could never see what they carried,
wasn’t that strange? All those trucks
on the highways of the world, packed with secrets.
Maybe the smallest thistle volunteering
near the fence, growing unnoticed,
or the person we’d never meet,
who never heard of us either,
walking in twilight on the beach at Sharjah,
dipping burgundy cloth into a soaking vat at
Mumbai,
crying for what was gone from Aleppo,
maybe they knew the best ways to survive.
To be alive was a wall, as often as a door.
But to live like a movable hinge . . .
Bamboo Mind
Popping profusely
small shoots of glimmering
interest
can you feel
the inner nudge?
Something wants to grow
needs sun
pressing up between blades of grass
you thought
were your real thoughts
Cross the Sea
A girl in Gaza
speaks into a table microphone:
Do you believe in infinity?
If so, what does it look like to you?
Not like a wall
Not like a soldier with a gun
Not like a ruined house
bombed out of being
Not like concrete wreckage
of a school’s good hope
a clinic’s best dream
In fact not like anything
imposed upon you and your family
thus far
in your precious thirteen years.
My infinity would be
the never-ending light
you deserve
every road opening up in front of you.
Soberly she nods her head.
In our time
voices cross the sea
easily
but sense is still difficult to come by.
Next girl’s question:
Were you ever shy?
To Babies
May polar bears welcome you
to northern Manitoba, their lumbering grace
marking the ice. May there still be ice.
May giant trees lean over your path
in warm places, brush your brow.
So many details now disappeared . . .
tiny toads in deserts, fireflies.
Where are the open window screens,
whispers of breeze against a sleeping cheek?
If we stop poking holes in soil,
watching onions grow,
what will we know? If we no longer learn cursive,
will our hand muscles disintegrate?
You blink, beginning to focus.
Where will the lost loops of handwritten “g’s”
and “y’s” go?
We dream you will have so much to admire.
Songbook
Tiny keyboard bearing the reverie of the past—
press one button, we’re carried away
on a country road,
marching with saints,
leaving the Red River Valley—
here is every holiday you hated, every hard time,
every steamy summer wish. You closed your eyes,
leaned your head against a wall,
knowing a bigger world
loomed. It’s still out there, and it’s tucked
in this keyboard too.
Now we are an organ, now an oboe,
now we are young or ancient,
smelling the haunted wallpaper in the house
our grandfather sold with every cabinet,
table and doily included,
but we are still adrift, floating,
thrum-full of longing layers of sound.

(How did this get into our shed?)
But give it away
because we know we will never
on any day
of any future year
do this
Bundle
Why didn’t you take a photograph
out the window of every place you ever stayed?
Clotheslines, balconies, food vendors,
could have focused on any one thing.
But I was lingering at the dock fascinated
by a seagull with a hopping gait.
Catching the breeze.
Scrap of pink ribbon,
yellow shovel half-buried in sand—
Or a picture of every classroom you inhabited,
even for an hour, the boy who said,
“I’m afraid I’m in love with the word lyrical,”
on a hundred-degree day,
pencil swooping across page.
He looked like the toughest customer in town
till he said that.
To wake with a word
Bundle
tucked between lips, and wonder all day
what it means . . . bundle of joys, troubles . . .
each day the single mystery-word could change.
Veil. Forget. Abandon.
And consider the people at any crossing walk,
how you will never cross with them again,
isn’t that enough to make a charm?
Or the careful ways we arrange a desk
wherever we stay,
temporary landscape—pencils, sharpener,
drifting moon of a cup over everything, silent and humble, bearing its own
hope.
Little Lady, Little Nugget Brooms
Hey Baltimore, I’ll take one—
do they exist anywhere
but on this fading wall?
Not all we love is gone, oh
Hunter & Elsie’s Café!
Find a ghost sign
for proof. Every disappeared menu
seeding your bones. Karam’s Mexican
Restaurant, more like an oasis it was,
west side San Antonio,
giant palms in back garden,
massive Aztec heads,
Ralph Karam’s cozy dream
wrecked for a Walgreen’s,
but can you still taste
the crackly corn chalupa
distinctiveness? Did not taste
like anywhere else.
Kalamazoo,
meandering around in you
at dawn, on a street
with real buildings older than
my grandpa,
were he still alive,
the Michigan Newsstand was well-lit
and ready to serve,
thousands of pages of new reading matter,
books, magazines,
step right up, believe in me,
and the whispery sign on the side of a building
Rooms for Rent 1 dollar hot supper
put my modern flying heart back in my body.
Welcome What Comes
1
Bearing secrets
underlying meanings
parallel possibility
hint of distance
company for the journey
doorstep treasure
gift wrapped loosely in bandanna
trail of ribbons
no address attached
traveling a long time over rocky terrain
trusting you were waiting
2
Some people grew up receiving no messages at all
but from people right in front of them.
Clean your room
Wash your hands
Homework!
Black phone in hallway nook rang so rarely,
it shocked us when it sang—
Grandma on birthdays, lonely insurance salesman.
No disembodied messages chirping up continuously
see this, read that, don’t miss . . . how did we
live?
We knew what was going on.
Always felt connected.
Tonight I wanted to return
to the days of someone telling me what to do.
At least then I thought I knew.
3
My old friend writes a real letter in the mail
I have not yet learned how to live, have you?
Wind still whips around our chimneys
Sunrises feel more precious
A blind dog wanders all night through fields
returning home next morning wet and exhausted
to wrap his paws around his person’s neck
What Happens Next
Ferguson, no one ever heard of you.
Unless they lived in Florissant, or Cool Valley,
we said “St. Louis” when we went away because
you were obscure, tucked in leafy green,
lost to humidity.
Sure, we could count on things—
farmer Al in baggy overalls, boxing tomatoes,
patient books lined at the library,
Hermit Lady sunken into tilting house.
Catholic pal said I could not step into his church
to see the painted statues, God would not approve,
I was not baptized, a drifter among
Ferguson’s ditches and trees.
We might have guessed your coming troubles,
white teacher reading Langston with a
throaty catch in her voice. The invisible line,
Kinloch on the other side. See that word? Kin in it.
Made no sense to kids. Only grown-ups saw the line.
We loved your fragrances and musky soil—
everyone so poor a dime or quarter could change a day,
but filled with longing—how to spend our bounty?
My Arab daddy always wanted to know more.
Evenings we watered the grass, the trees.
Driving slowly around “the other side,”
he waved at everyone, people called him reckless,
only Arab in town got away with curiosity.
Something had to be better than
the separations humans make—
at four, I am climbing steep stairs
of the house next door.
If I sit quietly, the teenager who lives inside
will emerge and brush my hair.
She presses hard, down to the scalp.
I belong to her too.
Everything Changes the World
Boys kicking a ball on a beach,
women with cook pots,
men bombing tender patches of mint.
There is no righteous position.
Only places where brown feet
touch the earth.
Maybe you call it yours.
Maybe someone else runs it.
What do you prefer?
We who are far
stagger under the mind blade.
Every crushed home,
every story worth telling.
Think how much you’d need to say
if that were your friend.
If one of your people
equals hundreds of ours,
what does that say about people?
Standing Back
If this is the best you can do, citizens of the world,
I resolve to become summer shadow,
turtle adrift in a pool.
Today a frog waited in a patch of jasmine
for drizzles of wet before dawn.
The proud way he rose when water
touched his skin—
his simple joy at another morning—
compare this to bombing,
shooting, wrecking,
in more countries than we can count
and ask yourself—human or frog?
Three Hundred Goats
In icy fields.
Is water flowing in the tank?
(Is it the year of the sheep or the goat?
Chinese zodiac inconclusive . . . )
Will they huddle together, warm bodies pressing?
O lead them to a secluded corner,
little ones toward bulkier mothers.
Lead them to the brush, which cuts the wind.
Another frigid night swooping down—
Aren’t you worried about them, I ask my friend,
who lives by herself on the ranch of goats,
far from here near the town of Ozona.
She shrugs, “Not really,
they know what to do. They’re goats.”
Lost People
“The blue bird carries the sky on his back.”
—Henry David Thoreau, unpublished works
For years I looked for my lost friend. We did so much mischief together,
made our own tiny language, wore overalls, walked twenty miles—
when someone else’s mother said we would
“get over” Henry David Thoreau,
we knew it was not true.
Finally—“Your previous letter arrived,
but I kept it many months without answering
so it seemed to get longer. Sorry—it grew too long to answer
so I never . . . did.”
Once we were dandelion fluff
raggedy blue jeans
quoting Henry under yellow bell esperanza trees.
Everything already happening
rush
sizzle
miracle of becoming on
earth & we would not miss one note.
Steeped in quietude
buzzing joy
that could never fall onto a
to-do list
dish soap
paper clips
Write her a short note now—
only sky
between the words
Broken
What was precious—flexing.
Fingers wrapping bottle, jar,
fluent weave of tendon, bone, and nerve.
To grip a handle, lift a bag of books,
button simply, fold a card—
I did not feel magnificent.
Unthinking movement, come again.
These days of slow reknitting,
stoked with pain . . .
“Revise the scene of injury in your mind,”
suggested Kathleen, so then I did not
snap against the root, but just became it.
Thank your ankles, thank your wrists.
How many gifts have we not named?
Twilight
Victor the taxi driver says
I love this time of day
This is when I say
Never want to die
want to be here forever
Oh maybe it will be possible,
in the shaggy heads of trees
that barely felt us
walking beneath them
The corners we turned so often
broken pavements
cracks & signatures
Daniel Lozano 1962
All the days we entered thoughtlessly
forgetting to turn our heads or bow
to the vine finally making it over the fence
dangling blossom
orange cup of joy
ephemeral as we were
here
imagining our deep roots
VOICES IN THE AIR
People do not pass away.
They die
and then they stay.
For Aziz
I had not noticed
the delicate yellow flower
strikingly thin petals
like a man with many hopes
or a woman with many dreams
the center almost a tiny hive
ants could crawl in and out of
if they wished
Had not noticed the profusion
of flowers on the path
Had not stooped
to absorb the silent glory
of many-petaled yellow
or remembered the freshness
of my father’s collar
for some years now
the rush of anticipation
circling his morning self
despite so much hard history
and searing news
Who can help us?
Yellow beam

Sheep by the Sea
a painting by Rosa Bonheur (1865)
The calm of your wool, rounded resting postures,
hooves tucked under.
Behind you, roiling waves pound, whitecaps against
stones.
Your eyes have been closed for a hundred and
forty-eight years.
But you seem not to fear what is coming. You curl in
repose,
Pink velvet of your ears echoing the pink tips of the
grasses.
People have always been shepherds for sheep,
but I’d like
to let you lead. Quiet depth, a measured gentleness.
Here in a museum in Washington, D. C.
Emily
What would you do if you knew
that even during wartime
scholars in Baghdad
were translating your poems
into Arabic
still believing
in the thing with feathers?
You wouldn’t feel lonely
That’s for sure.
Words finding friends
even if written on envelope flaps
or left in a drawer.
Warbler Woods
For Peter Matthiessen
Never too proud to tip his head back.
To gaze, look beyond.
Something nesting in leaves, unseen,
presence on a boulder beside water,
single strong leg.
Fine if it took a long time to walk there.
Better if it took time . . .
He knew the names of every warbler,
stitched inside his skin,
the seven eagles, graceful cranes, he followed them
to tucked-away forests and creeks, could see
a slightest flicker of movement,
a nesting memory, how the world was once,
would never be again.
He could stand under skies for hours,
never weary of their habits, never tire.
When did humans equal this glory?
Glory of feather and snippet.
Glory of the rangeless distances—
abundant glide.
When did humans soar so high?
Gratitude Pillow
“Let gratitude be the pillow upon which you kneel . . .”
—Maya Angelou
Maya loved the jingle of the massive key ring
carried by cable car conductors. First woman
in the San Francisco trolley uniform,
she liked the shiny buttons on the jacket,
appreciated the swoops and dips of the routes,
sharp curves, corners, bustling avenues.
Clinking coin dispenser latched to her belt,
she’d be a conductor all her life. Write, and talk,
take people everywhere, out of their tight little
rooms.
And if anyone told her they were going
to Gloomy Street,
she’d say, What? Lift those eyes. Take a look at the
sea to your right, buildings full of mysteries, schools
crackling with joy, open porches,
watch the world whirl by,
all we are given without having to own, and shake that gloom right out of
your system!
Hope is the only drink you need
to be drinking—jingle, jingle, step right up.
Life Loves
to change, wrote poet John Masefield,
in the cobbled town of Ledbury, Herefordshire,
Elizabeth Barrett Browning’s town too.
Precise crosswalks, Saturday cheese markets,
hourly church bells bonging with conviction.
A man called Ledbury one of the few “real towns” left in England, meaning
—sad to say—they don’t have many immigrants. (Took me a week to
figure
this out.)
Too bad, for it was easy to imagine
hiding out down Cottage Lane behind
massive white roses for years,
paper-wrapped hunk of greasy fish and chips
on the iron garden table. Who knows how many lives long for any one
of us? Who else we might be?
We’re thirsty for a cider shop’s thirty faucets,
no idea which is best. Whatever you say! We’re not headed to Hope’s End,
where Elizabeth lived, we’re awash in Hope’s Beginnings.
Haunting the old-fashioned print shop, plucking sheaves of discarded
margins from rubbish bin—
long thin creamy strips—
basking in disgusted teen chatter
on the green by the graveyard,
holding the air. It became my air too quickly.
I felt drunk on general coziness . . .
thinking of Elizabeth,
whose “father never spoke to her again,” once she had a child (what was his
problem?),
and Masefield, who suffered intense seasickness
yet wrote about going down to the sea
as if it were his favorite act.
Walking everywhere, pausing for slow crossing lights,
nodding conspiratorially to ladies with canes hiking hill path at
dawn . . .
Life loves to change—but some of us want to stay.
Getting Over It
Years ago, the writer and translator Coleman Barks & I met up in Rome,
Georgia, a town that had once been the home of his grandmother, to eat
Chinese food with friends. He drove us to the restaurant. I was on a nine-
day poetry tour of Georgia, filling in for someone who had cancelled at the
last moment. The sheriff of Macon had attended my reading & told me his
real dream was to be a writer. The Branch Davidians in Waco had just
burned up. I was lugging my canvas poetry bag stuffed with books & papers
into the restaurant.
Coleman said, Why drag that? Leave it in the car! It will be safe!
No, I said. Everything I need is in this bag. I keep it right next to me.
That is ridiculous, he said. No one will take a bag of books.
We ate a delicious dinner & upon returning to the car, discovered it had
been broken into & Coleman’s own bag taken—which contained his books,
personal journal, plane ticket to Turkey for the next week, passport,
drawings by his granddaughter—many treasures.
He was shocked. He said something about my worry having attracted
negative attention to the vehicle. He wasn’t blaming, just musing. I said I
wasn’t worried, really—I always lugged my bag.
Coleman called the police. They looked around vaguely & loaned us a giant
flashlight, saying we could return it to the police station the next day.
A whirl of awkward searching through weedy ditches & smelly Dumpsters
turned up nothing. We kept looking & hoping, in case the thieves had
ransacked Coleman’s bag for money, then thrown the rest of it away.
We searched into the night.
I got angrier on Coleman’s behalf as the search went on, but he grew
calmer. How can people take what isn’t theirs? I thought about refugees, my
father, women who are attacked unexpectedly, then have to accommodate
that brutal shock into the future, too many things. Coleman apparently kept
his mind on the bag.
Around midnight, he said, “How long does one stay robbed, after being
robbed? I think I’m over it.”
He drove me back to the house where I was spending the night. My friendly
host, artist and writer Susan Gilbert Harvey, was still awake. She thought
we might have been abducted. I told her what had happened & what
Coleman said, which caused us to suspend our search. Susan burst into
tears.
She said, “That’s it. That’s it exactly. That’s what I’ve been needing to hear.
Such a gift!”
Conversation with Grace Paley, Flight of
the Mind Writing Workshop, Oregon
It’s been a spectacular day, Grace!
We gushed
And she cleared her throat.
Not that great, she said—
But pretty good.
Didn’t you like our long drive into the woods
to see trees with rounded buttocks?
They were okay.
Our splendid dinner?
Tasty.
Grace, guide us! What is politics to you?
You are such a brave activist!
How do we live, what do we do?
Politics is simply the way human beings treat
one another on the earth.
Showing Up
For Lucille Clifton
Where else would I be? said Lucille, after surgeries
and months of pain, where else? She swooped back
into action, visiting with students, attending readings,
sending out her beams. Some people are born
to be present, hold the note.
Shape a mouth around words, air them fully,
convince others they could do this too.
We’re such skinny souls sometimes,
brimming with excuses for inaction,
passing the blame.
Lucille’s own daddy had said,
“All good-byes ain’t gone”—and she carried that truth—
Hello again!—even when she’d been laid up in hospital for a while.
Never mind!
Picture the whirl of energy
beneath each human move—
circulating, rising with every
step. Lucille stayed late, singing the song of
carrying on, admitting the truth . . .
“Things don’t fall apart. Things hold. Lines connect in thin ways that last
and last . . .”
Lucille gave everything she had.
For Caroline M.
What does it mean when, across fifty years and a thousand miles, a voice
literally reaches out of the sky, Naomi! I did it! Good-bye!
and you dial rapidly, last number you had for her,
to find the nurses scrambling, since they haven’t
even reached her brother yet,
and you say, Now! Now! Let me speak to her!
and they say, You can’t!
so you know she just wanted to alert you,
have you as witness she finally broke free,
same way she used to announce
she was driving into town
in the rattled truck with the crushed bumper—
Good-bye! Try to finish up those rows before you leave, okay?
so you’d know she still had her eye on you
always watching even when she wasn’t present—
you were the only girl at the farm, except for her.
Caroline and her husband, whom you worked for at
twelve,
attempting to impress them with your berry-picking
skills,
tin can looped around your neck. She wasn’t sure you could stand it, spoken
day one, but grew impressed by your love for heat, your trance-like
gathering.
Years later, whenever you returned to town,
you always stopped to hike up the dirt drive
into sweet-soil-smelling paradise,
flag of honest organic farming
growing more precious in the world.
Caroline, I still love your tomatoes, don’t you?
I hate tomatoes, they smell like work.
Also, I never liked farming, you know, I only loved him.
What?
I was a city girl. Or wanted to be.
Seriously?
More layers than anyone can see,
roots threading into soil, tightening the grip,
leaving you standing on the land years after she
called you without a phone, whispering,
Blackberries, tomatoes.
Thank you.
I’m home.
Tomorrow
For José Emilio Pacheco who said, “I like poetry to be the interior voice, the voice no one hears,
the voice of the person reading it.”
1
What animal is waiting to hear what we have to say?
Not one. Not the red-winged blackbird,
the speckled trout
or the French Chartreux. Beg an iguana
for editorial advice.
Whatever we do, slim drift on the wind.
We could talk forever, never equaling the dawn song of the thrush.
Pacheco said, “Fish don’t torture. Their banks don’t ever charge interest.”
We open our mouths.
We find and hide the words.
2
My friend who knew him says, “I thought of him
as a businessman only. A lawyer? Had no idea he wrote poems.”
She found him dignified, stately, quiet.
Papers, envelopes, nice neckties, polished desk.
José Emilio, your “certain silences”
were invisible girders.
They held everything up. Childhood stories,
first moments, “. . . we go never to come back.”
No wonder you translated Beckett, Yevtushenko . . .
belonging to other worlds deepened our own.
You wanted to ask your old teachers if the Future—“Tomorrow”—
lived up to their dreams. Everyone’s hard work, supposed to count for
everything, right?
Who predicted torture, murder, people
disappeared?
Didn’t those people work hard too?
Which animals live like this?
Could metaphor soothe or save?
There are nine moths to every one butterfly.
Your poems at first surrealistic, then closer to home.
Fancy awards, dramatic titles, did not intrigue.
Your pants fell down when meeting a king, but you hiked them up, calling it
a cure for vanity.
We love you forever for moments like this.
Leaning into your pages all those years—
working and working. “All that is truly ours now
is the day that is beginning.” Once we gleaned what went on in high places
—
our job to build something better.
After Listening to Paul Durcan, Ireland
“Should there be anyone who has not got mixed feelings?
Could there be anyone who has not got mixed feelings?”
Poured full of ripe language
but no mixed feelings about
how much we adore him
we lift into night
buttery streetlamp glow
gray sweaters and topcoats
unbuttoned at the throat
pearls and nubby mufflers
tonight the cream of understanding
elevated elegance of sound
funny quirky joy
two neighbors who never met before
meet in a doctor’s office and end up befriending
each other same way you could hear poems
and feel restored to clear notes
so when we step into the street
taxis bunching and idling
bowed heads
silent grins
we have those notes to go by
deeper current
streaming into the fluent dark
We Will Get Lost in You
“You forget everything when you play—that’s why you do it, actually.”
—Leo Kottke, guitarist
Joni Mitchell said in an interview, Everything I am, I’m not.
Bigger. Smaller. Entirely invisible. A painter, not a musician.
Secrets you never dreamed. Somewhere else.
Tish jumped over a fence. Tish narrated a story—
where people went when they disappeared, inside your own skin.
Lay your burden down—no, dissolve your burden! Not your burden! Bruce
kept singing from
an engine deep inside.
We could walk the halls where Robert Johnson walked. Patty Griffin, The
further I go,
more letters from home never arrive. Not to be lost.
Amidst millions of people, calm sanctuaries of sound in Tokyo, beyond the
Sad Café,
Joanna Newsom’s high notes
weaving harp trills, lifting a crowd to the ceiling.
Or Minnesota when winter was nearly over,
Sara Thomsen stomping, Too many roosters
in the White House! Yep. Spirits in time of disaster.
You! Can do it when you open your mouth, right?
There Will Be a Light, when politicians lie,
people insult,
when you didn’t want to read the comments on a
story but did,
and can’t stop wondering why people take time to be
cruel,
when they could be all those other things,
baby beating drum on a box, train clatter braking
into station,
pluck the string of the day and go away.
James Tate in Jerusalem
A writer whose lines could “ambush with wonder
and wit”
saved me once. In the rugged hills outside Jerusalem,
I was reeling with sadness, as usual, my people
pressed like cattle
by sharp butts of Israeli guns, herded through battered lines, endlessly
insulted,
(I wanted to fix it, always a problem, or translate us all into a better world),
when a guide climbed on our bus wearing
a FREE TIBET T-shirt.
Jim just looked at me. He saw it too.
“That’s thoughtful.”
Something cracked.
Sanity ambushed day after day. His kindness
made a calm place in my fury.
He drank a Pepsi. I seethed.
His words cool and angled, pieced together like triangles in a quilt stitched
by the calm Amish.
Blue and green don’t fight.
Trust me. We have sunk so low in this valley of repetition we forgot how to
sew a seam.
Train Across Texas
For Langston Hughes
Langston, what did Texas look like back then,
where were you going?
From your seat on the train, the small table,
you encouraged your pen pals,
timid Baltimore sisters,
who had shared their writing with you,
and no one else.
Sure you can do it. You are doing it!
Sent them gloriously handwritten
black-inked letters . . .
sentences trailing across pages on neat tracks—
drew pictures in margins—hills outside the window,
a dining car waiter with a white towel folded over his
arm.
You had time on your beautiful ride, so much space to stare into, horizons
of thinking.
I believe in you. Don’t let anyone tell you
otherwise.
You knew what it was to be a busboy, wipe tables,
contemplate crusts, dregs of tea in a cup.
Urging your pen pals to remember their dreams
whatever shape they might be.
You were ready for the next installment . . . there were ways to get
anywhere you wanted to go,
if you really want to go.
And the land opened up in front of you.
The long land.
And the years in which you would be writing to every one of us
every day.
Longfellow’s Bed
For Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
seems too short for a man, especially one with
such a name, but they say it stretches six feet.
Dark wooden sleigh with coverlets,
bed to dive into, in another century,
to hide in, beyond flame and sorrow,
bed with large pillows to comfort
an aching trove of rhythms and syllables,
down by the Charles River we will go
when daylight shines. I wish I had known you,
Longfellow, but truly I did, as a small reader
with a book cracked wide, speaking aloud
on the old wooden stairs of my grandparents’ home,
saying your words, between the daylight
and the dark, swinging them like small lanterns
which have brought me to this place
by your bed on a late day in June,
in your yellow house by the giant linden tree,
still wondering at words and the length of a mattress.
Walt Whitman’s Revisions
“Transcendent! New! An American bard at last!”
(written about himself and his major life work, Leaves of Grass)
Trim the grass
Feed the grass
Water the grass
Direct the grass
This parched lawn
needs attention
What started as skinny chapbook
of twelve poems
grew into four hundred
in forty years
Who has such fortitude?
Walt was always working on the same book
First edition did not
have his name on cover
He reviewed himself in newspapers anonymously
quoted Ralph Waldo Emerson
without permission
on the spine
Emerson was not thrilled
Take a breath
Full breath
That’s what I call a poet
“Rest and Be Kind,
You Don’t Have to Prove Anything”
For Jack Kerouac, who said this was his best advice for writers
In 1972 I sat with Stella Kerouac in her St. Petersburg, Florida, home
thinking, “I can’t believe I’m really here, sitting in Jack’s lounger, Jack’s cat
nuzzling my foot, I can’t believe she let me in, I can’t believe she’s putting
these papers in my hands.”
Stella, who met Jack as a child. He was her younger brother’s friend.
She said it felt like only moments since Jack had died, though already it had
been a few years. She wanted me to read some unpublished pieces of Jack’s
fluent prose into a tape recorder. She was making an oral archive and
thought her own voice, after years of smoking, too coarse for posterity. My
hands trembled as I recorded his words, thinking, “This is a page he really
touched.” She thought papers might disappear, but cassette tapes were
going to last forever.
Some sweet, quick link had been established between Stella and me
weeks earlier, when I telephoned her from Texas on my forlorn twentieth
birthday (also Jack’s birthday), let the phone ring at least twenty times, and
finally heard her tearful “Hello?” I babbled into the phone, tentatively at
first, since I’d heard she was reclusive. I expected her to hang up at any
moment. She didn’t hang up. She said she’d been kneeling by Jack’s bed
missing him on his birthday, wondering if anyone anywhere might be
thinking about him right then. Perfect timing. I couldn’t stop thinking about
him. She invited me to come visit her.
My parents drove me down. I was going to take the bus, but they were
always so good about driving me. The library? Violin lessons? Jack
Kerouac’s house in Florida? Sure, let’s drive.
They dropped me off and went away to the beach. For a few days Stella
and I talked, ate tuna fish, pawed through closets, and didn’t answer the
phone. The phone rang frequently, but she wouldn’t touch it. “It’s his
phone, not mine,” she said. Indeed, the phone was still listed under Jack
Kerouac in the directory, which was how I had found her. We used to call
Information. There was no answering machine.
Jack’s mother, Gabrielle, still living in a back bedroom, shook a tinny
bell for attention. Stella rushed off to see what she needed. Trays of food
and lemonade traveled to the bedroom and returned empty. I wanted to meet
Gabrielle very much, but Stella said she was “beyond meeting people.”
Gabrielle sent her greetings to me out in the front room, signed a little navy
blue Christmas chapbook by Jack for me, and said to take it easy.
Stella fed their cats at the kitchen table as if they were people. She set
places for them. They sat on high stools, putting their mouths up to their
plates. We sat at either end of the table. It seemed natural while we were
doing it.
Later she would try to give me the gray kitten of one of Jack’s cats. I
loved this idea. We had many phone conversations about how the cat might
be sent from Florida to Texas—I recall discussing a bus trip, but the cat
could not travel by itself. A plane was expensive. The whole operation
seemed too stressful a prospect for the kitten, however we imagined it, and
was never accomplished.
Then the phone in their kitchen rang again. This time, Stella told me to
answer it. I fumbled the receiver. “Hello?”
“Who’s this?” said a faraway voice.
“I’m visiting Stella,” I stuttered.
“Well, put her on, would you? This is Allen Ginsberg.”
When I said, “Allen Ginsberg,” Stella put her hand out. She talked to
him. She was friendly. I thought about the reading he’d given at our college
in Texas that year, incense adrift on the air, his harmonium humming. We’d
all gone into a sandalwood poetry trance, sitting with legs crossed, smiling
back at him. Never had I imagined I’d be sitting in Kerouac’s house when I
heard his voice again.
As Stella handed the receiver back to me to hang it up, she sighed and
said, “That Allen . . . I can always tell when it’s Allen. It has a different
ring.”

Never stop your efforts for peace!
walking till someone offered a bed
fasting till they offered food
Personal peace necessary before world peace!
Every good thing you say . . . vibrates on and on
and never ceases!
I am standing outside under ageless pecan trees
listening to the voice I first heard in my parents’ living room
as a girl of three
Would you kill a cow?
The three-year-old said, Never!
Then how can you eat meat?
Why let someone else do your dirty work for you?
She was thrilled to turn kids into vegetarians
I’m only a little person but
there are lots of little things to be done!
C. D. Stepped Out
“I believe words are golden as goodness is golden. Even the humble word brush gives off a scratch
of light.”
—C. D. Wright
C. D. stepped out into the dark.
Didn’t tell anyone she was going—
she just left.
Some of us thought she was inside
in the bathroom on the second floor,
so we waited for her.
Some of us thought she was in the backyard
on a metal chair, listening.
Dark Street, MacDougal at Houston—
old furniture piled on sidewalks—
rooms of light in ancient brick buildings—
somehow she had inhabited every one
of those rooms one time or another.
She heard the twining chorus of accents,
carried them with her, rolling in her cells,
heard the roll and clash of citizens,
layerings of rooms draped with old India print,
Japanese kimono cloth, some rustic basket weave of
putty grays.
It was time, enough of this talk,
I heard you all, heard you better
than you heard me maybe, never mind, we’ll catch up later,
I just had to go.
True Success
“To travel hopefully is a better thing than to arrive . . . ”
—Robert Louis Stevenson
The hau tree under which you wrote holds fast
at Sans Souci Beach.
Memory curled in sap and cells—people now sit
in your favorite shade, near Waikiki,
drinking pinkish cocktails,
eating elegantly designed plates of rice and fish . . .
but the presence of one tall thin Scottish man
with a debonair mustache,
who leaned over his page, right here,
. . . feels more real.
Once you were packing your leather valise in old
gray Edinburgh—
farewell to the fireplace, the daily chill rain, the
cough.
You dreamed of ships, currents, a warm pause with a horizon on it—
already you’d written Jekyll and Hyde in a week,
and the poem about lying abed on pillows,
creating a country of toys in the sheets,
that would comfort sick children for decades.
When you, Robert (your wife called you “Louis”),
arrived for a time on O’ahu—ink pen and hat—
you quickly made a new life in a gangly bungalow
on Queen Emma Street,
preferring soft rain against misty green
mountains,
clean bright air, sailboats—to the colder worlds you
had known.
Writing outside in sun under a twisty tree became
your refuge.
“True success is to labor,” you said.
Though you died at forty-four,
who does more than what you did?
Making pages that would live so long . . . islands as treasures . . .
human lives as treasures . . .
you took a deep breath,
opened your packet of cheese and fruit, curled into
the words.
These branches still rustle.
Woven by Air, Texture of Air
“Your job is to find out what the world is trying to be.”
—William Stafford
Some birds hide in leaves so effectively
you don’t see they’re all around you.
Brown tilted heads, observing human maneuvers
on a sidewalk. Was that a crumb someone threw?
Picking and poking, no fanfare for company,
gray huddle on a branch, blending in.
Attention deeper than a whole day.
Who says, I’ll be a thoughtful bird when I grow up?
Stay humble, blend, belong to all directions.
Fly low, love a shadow. And sing, sing freely,
never let anything get in the way of your singing,
not darkness, not winter,
not the cries of flashier birds, not the silence
that finds you steadfast
pen ready, at the edge of four a.m.
Your day is so wide it will outlive everyone.
It has no roof, no sides.
Tell Us All the Gossip You Know
(How I was introduced at a writer’s club in small-town USA)
Gulp.
I’m a reader not a gossiper.
But we know you know some. So tell it.
Gulp.
Robert Bly said writing a bad poem before breakfast every day is a good
habit.
He did it in honor of his old friend Bill Stafford
(who also did it) after Bill died.
The poems were never bad, by the way.
They were great.
There were a lot of them.
You could work on them later, after you ate.
Leonard Nathan, chairman of the Department of
Rhetoric
at UC Berkeley, worried computers might diminish
one’s investment in a line. If you could just erase the line instantly, and
insert a new one—
well, it might be too easy.
Mary Oliver wanted to smell flowering pink bushes and blossoming trees in
Texas.
Pull over, she said, at more than one corner. She needed to absorb the
scents.
A city wasn’t just a name.
In her presence, babies might sing for the first time.
She is like that.
Ernest Hemingway ate an apple before writing.
This might or might not have explained his crisp, short sentences.
In the house where he died in Idaho, his shaving cream still sits inside the
medicine cabinet.
Ruth Stone wore a pale shimmering prom dress from—1930?—1940?—
to her poetry reading in Texas in the 1990s.
She said the dress was lonely hanging in her closet and wanted to be used.
Josephine Miles, who traveled with her wheelchair around the country to
read poems,
said, Don’t make your poem a neat package with a bow tied at the end. She
also said,
It’s hard to help.
Anyone can visit Walt Whitman’s birthing corner on Long Island.
The guide points and says, There, right there, he was born.
Some visitors can’t move on quickly
to the next room.
They are hypnotized.
What if Walt had never left this corner or stepped out into the streets
to do and say all he did?
Then who would we be?
Genine Lentine said she’d like to ban the word “flow”—I don’t understand
this
but respect her, so think about it. What’s wrong with “flow”? Are your
thoughts
flowing? Your words flowing? What’s up with this, Genine?
She does not care
for haiku.
William Burroughs also believed in taking Vitamin C.
Ken Kesey wore a Mexican serape and said Jack Kerouac got trapped in his
“own little
box”—that was his downfall. Can we really say anyone who changed so
many lives
had a downfall?
He just drank too much alcohol and had a shorter life than he might have
had.
Jack’s box was pretty vast.
William Goyen said writing started with trouble—
what you never worked out yet—just start there.
That thing in the street when you were seventeen?
Make it a story.
There is only one known video of Mark Twain, wearing a white linen suit in
1909,
walking outside a house in Connecticut,
talking with Thomas Edison.
Daria Donnelly’s last essay was about “literature of empathy.” Why we
need it in our crazy world.
Don’t put any Americans in your story for American kids, maybe.
Don’t make them heroes or villains, if you do.
On her tombstone she wanted
NEVER TASTED COCA-COLA.
Garth Williams got a letter from his close friend Margaret Wise Brown after
she died.
It traveled from Europe so it took a while.
When I visited Emily Dickinson’s house in Amherst,
a lively plump robin was sitting on her step,
right under the second-story window she would have stared out of.
John Steinbeck
would sharpen
twenty-four pencils every day
and write
till they were
dull.
Every Day
For Aziz, and Palestine
He loved the world and what might happen in it.
Some people labor to get up but
he was so ready to rise.
Refreshed and still alive
after the dark hours,
glistening with hope and cologne.
Must we love the world doubly much now
in his absence?
He is not absent.
Still living in the fig tree,
the carefully placed stone,
the draping mimosa.
In his empty notebooks, the lonely wooden chair.
We will keep it pulled up to the desk, just in case.
Just in case Justice suddenly walks into the room and says, Yes, I’m finally
here, sorry for the delay.
Tell me where to sign.
He tried to think the best of people.
His drawer was not stacked with disappointments.
Only folded white handkerchiefs still waiting.
After the storm, frogs and toads chorus along the pavement,
We believed! We believed!
One State
“I see no other way than to begin now to speak about sharing the land that has thrust us together and
sharing it in a truly democratic way, with equal rights for each citizen.”
—Dr. Edward Said
Hiding place inside the early hour—
You’re there.
Fold in the sky’s softest cloth—
what rises as we sleep,
the dark and ripe and narrow wedge.
You dropped every list of activities.
You’re off the hook.
And who are we?
Slice of the deep, hanging on hard.
Trying to do honor.
Situations getting worse.
Bumbling pie.
Hello, good morning, guess what,
you didn’t die.
My Name Is . . .
Their silence
is bigger
than our silence.
Chief Joseph
did not wish to go to Kansas.
He said, I think very little of this country.
It is like a poor man. It amounts to nothing.
Of course we realize a poor man can amount
to anything, Jesus was a poor man,
Gandhi, but Chief Joseph
had been kicked out of his valley, away from his gleaming Wallowa Lake,
and he was burned.
To this day you cannot walk there without aching.
Look at this earth.
How many adrift.
A man-in-exile read words and phrases
copied by a Syrian refugee boy
into a notebook dredged sopping from the Mediterranean, dried on the
shore. The boy was learning more words every day
before he went down, improving
his vocabulary, coming to a new world,
for safety and rescue. Please Madame, my name is Abdul,
this is my family, my brother, my sister, I am happy
to know you.
Invitation to the NSA
Feel free to scrutinize my messages. Welcome. Have fun fanning through
my private thoughts on drones, the Israeli Army chopping down olive trees,
endless wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, horrific from the get-go, and we told
you so, but no one listened because there was a lot of money and oomph in
it, so feel free to listen now. Bombs have no mothers. That is an insult to
mothers. See what I think about Bashar-al-Assad vs. the children of Syria,
pass it on, please, or weapons in general, the George W. Bush library in
Dallas which I refused to drive my mother past. I like the sense of you
looking over our shoulders, lifting up the skirts of our pages, peering under
my fury at how you forget Palestine again and again, forget the humble
people there, never calling them the victimized innocents as you call others.
You forget your promises, forget religion, Thou Shalt Not Kill, and yet you
kill, in so many ways, so what do we care? You might as well see what we
say.
Double Peace
For Yehuda Amichai
“If I try to be like him, who will be like me?”—Yiddish proverb
Not for him and his people alone
but for all who loved that rocky land
Everybody
everybody
sing it!
No chosen and unchosen but everybody chosen
Sing it!
All families living under tiled rooftops
Or flat roofs with strung clotheslines
T-shirts
bedsheets
flags of surrender
I show you my cloth
I live the way you live
All the cousins
second cousins
extra cousins
unknown cousins
No choice
everyone a cousin
peace better than hurtful moves
better
better
sing it!
Not rain that fell on a few houses only
Not sun that shone on a few favored yards
Not air in small containers only for some lungs
Double peace multiplied
Outside
inside
every ancient space
every sleek new room with tall windows
Peace for sheep and goats grazing in meadows
(They already have it)
Peace for buckets waiting on doorsteps
Peace in brown eggs lined on counters waiting to be
cracked
Peace in skillets and spatulas
We met at the corner
went to his home for
breakfast
He said, I would never have taken your father’s
home!
I could never have lived in a stolen Arab home!
The great voice of the Jewish people said this to
my face
our conversation
where streets converged
Break the Worry Cocoon
“Take them, use them, I beg you to travel.”
—Samih al-Qasim, from “Travel Tickets”
To live with what we are given—
graciously, as if our windows open wide as our neighbors’, as if there
weren’t insult at every turn.
How did you do that?
“. . . if social justice will be victorious in all the world . . . I don’t care who
will remember me or my poems.”
You sprang from the earth same way everyone does,
from the soil of your parents, the small bed and hopeful song.
Were pressed along through a century
that didn’t honor your people,
who washed their faces anyway,
stitched the dresses, buttoned shirts.
“. . . travel tickets . . . one to peace . . .
one to the fields and the rain, and one to the
conscience of humankind . . .”
How did you survive so much hurt and remain gracious,
finding words to mark the shapes
of grief, how did you believe,
then and forever, breaking out
of the endless worry cocoon,
something better might come your people’s way?
The Tent
When did hordes of sentences start
beginning with So—
as if everything were always pending,
leaning on what came before.
What can you expect?
Loneliness everywhere, entertained or kept in storage.
So you felt anxious to be alone.
Easier to hear, explore a city, room,
mound of hours, no one walking beside you.
Talking to self endlessly, but mostly listening.
This would not be strange.
It would be the tent you slept in.
Waking calmly inside whatever
you had to do would be freedom.
It would be your country.
The men in front of me had whole acres
in their eyes. I could feel them cross, recross each day.
Memory, stitched. History, soothed.
What we do or might prefer to do. Have done.
How we got here. Telling ourselves a story
till it’s compact enough to bear.
Passing the walls, wearing the sky,
the slight bow and rising of trees.
Everything ceaselessly holding us close.
So we are accompanied.
Never cast out without a line of language
to reel us back.
That is what happened, how I got here.
So maybe. One way anyway.
A story was sewn, seed sown,
this was what patriotism meant to me—
to be at home inside my own head long enough
to accept its infinite freedom
and move forward anywhere, to mysteries coming.
Even at night in a desert, temperatures plummet,
billowing tent flaps murmur to one another.
Please Sit Down
For Vera B. Williams
Your mama will have a chair
Everyone will have a chair
There are enough chairs
In the dreams we share
desks with smooth wooden tops
Name cards in calligraphy
cubbyholes under seats
What else might people be given?
When everyone sits calmly in chairs
Numbers march across pages
Letters line up friendly-fashion
Hopefully we might like those letters enough
to shape them into stories
Where have you been before here?
Who did you see?
A woman of sturdy conviction
clear, clear focus
making history with her hands
A garden, a muffin, a world?
Greedy men say “More!” to war
Sitting together telling stories
could change that but who will take the time?
Missiles faster
All our lives to speak of simple things
turns out to be
most complicated
For the Birds
“Why not?”—Dorothy Stafford’s late-life motto
Why aren’t you filling your feeders these days,
my mother asks—the birds are disappointed,
they keep landing on the feeder and flying away
looking sad. And I thought about our lives,
days crammed full of doings—so many messages,
do they feed us or make us fretful?
Maybe the birds are messages
too. But saying what? We watch them landing,
ruffling succulent soft brown layered wings,
wearing snazzy yellow beaks,
and I haul out the sack of seeds.
Bowing Candles
For John O’Donohue
How lonely your house feels, like the abandoned
house of an ancient shepherd, in the far Connemara
meadows.
Though I pictured it white, the outer walls are
muddy brown.
We peer through windows.
Candles on long wooden table
bend over at their waists,
wax softening in sun
bowing to your absence.
Still in shock, as are we. How could your voice be so
alive—then gone?
Nothing boxed or put away—you left unexpectedly.
I feel shy—never having met you but
remembering your graceful handwriting across years of letters—
and what did we say?
Yes of course, take it away, my poem is your poem,
all poems belong to anyone who loves them.
You carried light to tables—long tables
around the world like this wooden one
still waiting here—everyone remembers you—
serving light on plates with place mats.
You wrote about beauty, joy, belonging.
Quickly, someone must move into your house.
Black Car
For Van Morrison
Everyone still resonating, sliding
saxophone, searing plume of joy that lit the hall,
coating gilt ceiling, causing us all
to rise, raise our hands.
What it is to carry a voice like that.
From side stage door to back seat of car.
Crowd still hovering cheers again,
engine zooms into night.
Thank you. Thank you. Pressing the walk button
we fly.
MORE WORLDS
“Many Indians say they live in two worlds, but they actually have to live in
more than two worlds. If you live in one world you are pretty much stuck in
one place. Right now, I am living in the cab-driving world, the sober world,
the Indian world, the art world. The more worlds you live in, the better it
is.”
—FRANK BIG BEAR JR., ARTIST
Mountains
Jesse never felt smarter than at age six
the only first grader in a fifth-grade poetry workshop—
when they wrote about their neighborhood
his poem by far the best in the room
and he the first volunteer to stand and read it.
The big kids clapped for him and cheered.
He remembered this at twenty-one
when we crossed paths on Commerce Street.
Hey, hey! Could I ever feel like that again?
It was my Best Day!
Now working two jobs
two kids to support
Yes I think so
Do you read to your kids?
Do you have a library card?
Do you use it?
No
No
No
Start there, Jesse! You knew the truth
when you were six
that your street was magical
and full of mountains
though it was utterly flat.
You wrote about the rooster’s songs
and the dogs’ barkingful wonder.
You wrote Who do you think I am
am
am?
And knew instinctively it was more powerful to say
“am”
three times than one—
You are still that person.
Oh, Say Can You See
I’d like to take Donald Trump to Palestine,
set him free in the streets of Ramallah or Nablus
amidst all the winners who never gave up in sixty-nine years.
They’d like to make their country great again too,
if only their hands weren’t tied by the weapons
our country donates. Let’s talk about who belongs where,
how an immigrant to Israel is treated better than someone
who tended a tree for a hundred years. Who lies?
Let’s talk about lies. Give it a shout! They built a wall
so ugly, kids must dream of flying over,
or burrowing under, and it didn’t solve anything.
I’d wrap a keffiyeh around his head,
tuck some warm falafels into his pockets,
let him wander alleyways and streets,
rubble and hope mixing together,
nothing oversized, no tall towers,
just beautiful life, mint flourishing in a tin can,
schoolgirl in a fresh dress with a ruffle, mom and dad
staring from the windows—Can you see us?
Can you see any of us at all?
Anti-Inaugural
I pledge allegiance
To respect
For every one
Of you
Talking truth
is hard
Staying silent
should be harder
My voting preference?
Every person
In this city
Silence waits
For truth
To break it
You be my president,
I’ll be yours
We have never
paid
Enough attention
yet
Some days
we are
the fallen flower
Abundance!
Nature doesn’t shout.
Be brave
Little things
Still matter most
I Vote for You
For Connor James Nye
You smile at everyone. When lifted, toted,
you hold tightly to shoulder or sleeve.
Gazing curiously, each room, face,
Irish sheep, stuffed puppy.
Dwelling in a current of care,
you know nothing of cruelties people do
to one another.
You did not see the intricate avenues of Aleppo—
tiled ceilings, arching rooms.
The villages of Palestine
could still be neatly terraced in your brain.
When you smile, we might all be
wishing each other well.
When you startle at a loud sound,
await the power of softness
to settle you down. There is no other power
in your world.
Hunger, interest, kicking, joy—carry us there.
If your eyes fall heavily closed,
sweet rescue in the dozing.
What we might remember if we tried much harder.
In your dream no one is a refugee.
Everyone has clean sheets.
Belfast
(For Frankee & Paul)
I’m attached to everything
things that aren’t mine
places that aren’t mine
(nothing is mine)
fingers feeling for a switch in the dark
knowing how a knob turns or sticks
after only two days
click of the lock
attached to swerves
surprise
new corners
riding an elevator to the seventh floor of the old
linen mill
meeting artists
simply by knocking on their doors
Tell again—what was all that violence for?
Old Belfast
I’m attached to your red brick
peaks & pitches
compact neighborhoods
green slopes behind (they aren’t mine)
haunting yellow cranes at the Titanic shipyard
gray slate stones on the beach
(we could see Scotland
also not mine
but now I’m so attached to everything
I almost doubled in size)
attached to Stranmillis Road
swans
swifts
rivers
the glorious face of Queen’s University
we could start over
everything over
new world
new map
new life
and the baked potato with cheese and red beans
I kept hearing about
there is more
there is more
there is more
Summer
Up late watching TV commercials while waiting for the last quarter of the
basketball finals game—it’s clear what someone must think Americans
want: everything to blow up. Catastrophic explosions, chaos, car chases,
mobs of desperate people running from zombies, massive flying robot
creatures with their weapons pointed directly at us. It is NOW SUMMER
AND WE HAVE MADE THIS MOVIE FOR YOU. OPENING SOON.
Even the national capitol features giant flames spilling out of its dome.
These commercials will whet the appetites of fellow Americans who, only a
few decades ago, were happy with lightning bugs and lemonade. What
happened to us?

Reading Obituaries on the Day
of the Giant Moon
Is it possible to fall in love posthumously with someone’s stunningly
mismatched eyebrows
and straight-on gaze?
Kazue’s summary describes her as “a fiery woman even at seventy-three.”
I want to follow her blazing through the streets of
Hokkaido
where she was born and grew up,
then to Texas, where her “beloved husband” died
and “without skipping a beat”
she entered the “food industry.” What does this mean? Where did she cook?
How many beats do we skip every day?
“In lieu of flowers,” writes one of her sons,
“take your mother to dinner or enjoy a good meal
like Kazue would have wanted you to.”
Yesterday we buried fiery Hilda, eighty-six, who made everyone feel loved,
whose red poppies light up City Street each spring.
Did she call the whole world darling? No, just me,
just me.
But at her graveside, everyone else knew her better
than I did.
The neighborhood feels tipped.
Our house may slide into the river
without Hilda here, cozy in her tall rooms,
holding things back.
To Jamyla Bolden of Ferguson, Missouri
Fifty years before you did your homework
in Ferguson
we did our homework in Ferguson, thinking life was
fair.
If we didn’t do our homework we might get a U—
Unsatisfactory.
Your dad says you didn’t even get to see the rest of the world yet.
I’ve seen too much of the world and don’t know
how to absorb this—a girl shot through a wall—
U! U! U!
I’d give you some of my years if I could—
you should not have died that night—
there was absolutely no reason for you to die.
I’d like to be standing in a sprinkler with you,
the way we used to do, kids before air-conditioning,
safe with our friends in the drenching of cool,
safe with our shrieks, summer shorts, and happy hair.
Where can we go without thinking of you now?
Did you know there was a time Ferguson
was all a farm?
It fed St. Louis . . . giant meadows of corn,
sweet potatoes,
laden blackberry bushes, perfect tomatoes in crates,
and everything was shovels and hoes, and each life,
even the little tendril of a vine, mattered,
and you did your homework and got an S for Satisfactory, Super,
instead of the S of Sorrow
now stamped on our hands.
Your Answering Machine,
After Your Death
Picks up after four rings
And the hopeful lilt in your voice,
“I’ll call you back as soon as I can,”
gives no clue
this will never happen
Under leaning gray-green trees
doves stirring syllables at dawn
something unfinished
ripples its long wave—
opera of air unfurling daily light
shining on calendars
yours still
pinned to the wall
Ring
A letter survives.
The stamp has been ripped from the envelope—
my grandfather Carl collected stamps.
This may have been one of the few letters
loitering in his sad last room
up north under towering trees.
Safe from cities and strangers—
unfortunately he was not safe
from the condescending words
of his teenaged granddaughter.
I wrote to him as if speaking to a dog.
Have you missed me? I’m sure you did not.
Sorry to be so silent but I have been traveling,
was on a happy horse ranch, at a conference
for global enlightenment, with my friends,
in my full delicious life.
He had written me a critical letter
about studying religion in college—
I wanted to set him straight.
The final paragraph blazes with
indignity—silly Grandpa, the world
cannot stay narrow anymore. We are
building bridges among religions, no one true path,
opening our minds . . . who was I?
Vivid youth, so full of myself
and my conviction, I could not bear
his smallness. Did he reply? My guess
would be no. But all these years
I have worn the last thing he gave me,
the only thing, a ring with one black stone.
Hummingbird
“The world is big and I want to have a good look at it before it gets dark.”
—John Muir
Lyda Rose asked, “Are you a grown-up?”
The most flattering question of my adult life.
She darted around me like a hummingbird,
knotted in gauzy pink scarves,
braiding thyme into my hair.
There, on the brink of summer,
all summers blurred.
“No,” I said.
“I don’t think so.
I don’t want to be.”
“What are you then?”
Her dog snored by the couch,
little sister dozed on a pillow.
When her mom came home, we’d drink hot tea,
talk about our dead fathers, and cry.
“I think I’m a turtle,” I said. “Hibernating.”
“And a mouse in the moss.
And sometimes a hummingbird like you.”
She jumped on my stomach then.
Asked if I’d ever worn a tutu
like the frayed pink one
she favored the whole spring.
No, not that.
“I have a shovel though,” I said.
“For digging in the garden every night
before dark. And a small piano like yours
that pretends to be a harpsichord.
And I really love my broom.”
Next Time Ask More Questions
Before leaping into something, remember
the span of time is long and gracious.
No one perches dangerously on any cliff
till you reply. Is there a pouch of rain
desperately thirsty people wait to drink from
if you say yes or no? I don’t think so.
Never embrace “crucial” or “urgent”—maybe for them?
Those are not your words.
Hold your horses and your mania and these
Hong Kong dollar coins in your pocket.
I’m not a corner or a critical turning page.
Wait. I’ll think about it.
This pressure you share is a fantasy,
a misplaced hinge.
Maybe I’m already where I need to be.
In Transit
I mailed a package to myself, it never arrived.
Months later, wondering what it contained . . .
the package was oversized, I paid extra.
Mailed it from a place under trees. Surely shade
and sunlight was in the package. Mailed it
from a place compassionate to refugees.
Unopened envelopes inside the package,
poems from kind students hoping for response.
How do we answer without knowing
who they were or what they said?
This is why you must smile at everyone,
living and dead, everywhere you go.
You have no idea what has been lost
in transit.
Zen Boy
Why do you have
only one bowl?
I asked our son
helping him arrange
new kitchen cabinets
three plates
three mugs
three glasses
one bowl
a red oatmeal-
sized bowl
He smiled
I like
having only one bowl
Where Do Poets Find Images?
Giant stone turtle on a beach at Nansha, China.
Tired-looking father sits on the turtle,
gripping a child’s striped jacket.
Toddlers scrabble in sand at his feet.
You will never be able to talk to him,
but can imagine something about him.
He lifts his eyes to you, but doesn’t nod.
Or the tree with starry pink flowers
outside the classroom window.
Nobody knows its name, but the trunk has thorns,
everyone has a story involving the thorns.
It has always been this way—more nearby
than anyone could recall or describe.
M. C. Richards, who wrote Centering, said,
It takes a long time to learn that nothing is wasted.
She also said, Poets are not the only poets.
Here, a few glittering bits on a table.
What’s on your table?
Tiny camel that travels thousands of miles
but still brays when you pinch its belly.
What can’t you explain?
That motorized monkey with a scary face
pulling a child’s rickshaw at the Fun Park.
Whose fun? The child looks terrified.
What surprised you lately?
Everything. Walking by water at sunset.
Remembering, I’m in China.
Evening ferry setting off for Hong Kong.
Cell Phone Tower Disguised as a Tree
Nansha, China
Spiky white tip at the top, the give-away.
Women kneel in gardens nearby, plucking weeds,
triangular straw hats on their heads,
rakes propped against real trees.
Do they feel a sizzling in the air?
Next to the tower, its false needles
a deeper piney green, real trees seem pale.
Invisible cobras burrow and slither
in the underbrush. “Be careful,” kids say.
“They see you before you see them.”
Guangdong Province,
“the most industrialized region on earth,”
gray skyscrapers pinned in line on horizons.
Everything IKEA sells is made here.
Easy to imagine the apartments’ modestly sized
interiors,
bathroom drains, steel sinks, kitchen stools,
bunks, modest light wood shelving, and the people
far from their home villages calling one another,
any way they can, between working hours,
from balconies, cupping weary hands over the phones,
calling through the tree.
Before I Was a Gazan
I was a boy
and my homework was missing,
paper with numbers on it,
stacked and lined,
I was looking for my piece of paper,
proud of this plus that, then multiplied,
not remembering if I had left it
on the table after showing to my uncle
or the shelf after combing my hair
but it was still somewhere
and I was going to find it and turn it in,
make my teacher happy,
make her say my name to the whole class,
before everything got subtracted
in a minute
even my uncle
even my teacher
even the best math student and his baby sister
who couldn’t talk yet.
And now I would do anything
for a problem I could solve.
Morning Ablution
Such luxury—
we select a cup.
What power, politics?
We have a house.
Dry ground cracks
in multiple patterns.
Even if you can’t fix everything
you can fix something.
I am allowed
to leave my country.
No one moves in
while I am gone.
What about moving in
while we are still here?
O Palestine!
If you plant something,
it might grow.
What Do Palestinians Want?
A man in the Lake District, England, asked me . . .
The pleasure of tending, tending
something that will not be taken away.
A family, a tree, growing for so long,
finally fruiting olives, the benevolence of branch,
and not to find a chopped trunk upon return.
Confidence in a threshold. A little green.
And quite a modest green untouched by drama.
Or a mound of calico coverlets stuffed with wool,
from one’s own sheep, piled in a cupboard.
To find them still piled. Is that too much?
Not to dominate. Never to say we are the only people who count,
or to be the only victims,
the chosen, more holy or precious.
No. Just to be ones who matter
as much as any other, in a common way, as you might prefer.
Stones and books and daily freedom.
A little neighborly respect.
Arabs in Finland
Their language rolls out,
soft carpet in front of them.
They stroll beneath trees,
women in scarves,
men in white shirts,
belts, baggy trousers.
What they left to be here,
in the cold country,
where winter lasts forever,
haunts them in the dark—
golden hue of souk in sunlight,
gentle calling through streets that said,
Brother, Sister, sit with me a minute,
on the small stool
with the steaming glass of tea.
Sit with me.
We belong together.
Ladders in Repose
Glorious resting folded.
Humans with no desire for achievement beyond
apprehension of one clear moment after another
may appreciate you, not for what
you would help us do,
but—your neat rungs, calm radiance.
Against the side of the shed, all summer you shone.
I could have trimmed a tree.
Your silver song of waiting filled me.
Sometimes while driving far out among fields,
dry dead ruined fields, crisped by oil madness
and spill,
or the parched corn rows of August,
in the ditch by the road, a ladder.
You know it must have flown off a truck,
someone later missed it. Lying horizontal
among overgrown weeds, disappearing
nearly abandoned vertical dreams.
The Gift
Our neighbor Mrs. Esquivel
insists I haul her giant cactus away.
It’s planted in a bucket.
Gives you thorns
when you barely brush past it.
Me no like it, please take, please help me,
she says again and again.
Me old. No good. Too big. It bites.
She’s busy hanging four white socks
on her clothesline.
I return
with our green wheelbarrow.
The cactus tips over a lot
traveling to our house.
It’s a cumbersome cactus.
Skin on fire. This cactus has a bad attitude.
Me no like it either but now
it’s mine mine mine.
Voodoo Spoons
When her father the old man died
I was called to witness, to say
Yes, he really seems dead, and I knew
we were entering another phase.
No more would he raise his hand to me
from the porch across the park.
No more asking what I knew, begging for a hug,
thanking me for pie.
Now I had to hide from his daughter
whenever she came dragging a branch
or box down the sidewalk,
orange scarf tied under her chin.
The way she screamed my name
like a horror movie.
I had to dash inside
as if I hadn’t heard, otherwise
doomed to many minutes of mad chat—
not one scrap of sense.
But I couldn’t stop leaving things on her porch,
as I had done with her father for years . . .
it was my habit,
never guessing she would think
they came from a spirit on the other side,
a hawk, or a bat. Antique spoons in a bundle,
nubbly vintage suit with golden buttons,
holy card with glowing heart of wings.
He’d always known this meant, I’m thinking of you.
But she thought—they’re watching,
I’m circled by eyes,
if I don’t drink pomegranate juice, I’m doomed!
Barbershop
For Mary Endo, written about in the Honolulu Star Advertiser
Mary of Kalihi is closing down.
Today her last after sixty-two years of trimming hair,
soaping necks, Mary with the pink-and-white
candy-striped awning,
who gives an opinion, no topic taboo.
A man is quoted, “She was the one person
in my life I could always talk to.”
Mary you could count on,
sixty-two years hardly a drop in the shaving mug,
bring her a thank you bigger than Honolulu,
bring her a hug, your whole life she was in here—
now banished by a landlord
you would personally like to shear.
What else will they build in this spot?
It’s just a little shop.
Mary at ninety-one is taking it in stride.
She’ll get dressed
next Monday as usual,
but “doesn’t know where she’ll go.”
When you swing the door,
she’s cutting a guy’s hair
on her last day, wearing a ruffled pink apron,
her own hair perfectly styled.
She looks quizzical when you hand over
the newspaper feature
and one giant red rose.
Guy says, “See, Mary,
everybody loves you, even strangers!”
Four chairs of people waiting,
regulars lined up for a last conversation,
last clip. What is the size of this farewell?
Mary, Mary, you have such a strong grip.
Getaway Car, United States, 2017
Deep grooves of dust atop the books in our shelves.
Anyone else feel a constant need to apologize?
What happened in our nation? The only person
in our family who could translate is dead.
When I close my eyes, someone hopeful
cups a hand over a candle. This shadow has no face.
Weather, soon to deteriorate—I love how people
say that. Right now we find little refuge inside a room.
Old Highway 90 heading west through Castroville . . .
a bakery offers square cheese pockets,
unsweet palm-sized delectable treats.
Maybe that’s what we need.
Leaving the gray bulk of the city, ugly crush
of abandoned strip centers, sickening graffiti, happens
so quickly—a day’s hand opens to release you.
Soon we will need to drive even farther,
to ruined towns like Langtry and Sanderson,
where the internet won’t work to report
what our country has done. Maybe there is a cave
no one lived in since the Kiowa, with no writing
on any walls, no painted pictures of animals or flames,
just an ancient heap of ashes in one corner.
There were times we thought the stone ages
behind us.
“Little Brother Shot Playing with Pistol”
His sister runs screaming from the church,
jacket slips from one shoulder to the floor.
No carpet should be red today.
No one singing, “Precious Lord.”
For the next number, “I Won’t Complain”
a crowd of wailing women rise up,
aunties and grandmas banging handbags
against the backs of pews.
“At least he’s not suffering”—
wouldn’t most dead people
rather be suffering?
Moment of Relief
News loves to be bad.
It’s a bad habit.
Think of all the good things people do—
Right now, how many people in our own town
are stirring soup to give away . . .
Bad news still gets more attention,
trash talk, insult . . .
At some point you make a decision.
Which world?
Malala, smiling warmly, speaks of dreams,
girls going to school,
mutual respect.
The newscasters stick her in
after lots of badness.
They know we can only take so much.
Unbelievable Things
My friend did not hear the sleek silent new electric bus coming. She had
stepped off a curb—the bus threw her into the air. A woman with many
children dashed to her rescue. Although my friend was shaken up and
bruised, no bones were broken and she went to work the next day. Within
the same week, in an entirely different part of town, my friend returned to
find her parked car had been hit, the side mirror snapped off. A note of
apology, with insurance information, was folded under the windshield
wiper. The car had been hit by a bus.
I had lunch with the president of Finland while wearing a gray linen shift
dress I had purchased for fifty cents in a thrift shop in Rock Springs,
Wyoming.
Michael pushed a shopping cart filled with boring Home Depot items—
wires, hoses, plumbing connectives, a can of primer—toward his car. He
removed his hands from the cart for a moment to reach into his pocket for
keys and a man dashed up from behind and began rolling the cart away.
Hey, wait a minute! Michael called out. What are you doing?
The man said, Finders, Keepers.
Way up north in Aroostook County, Maine, the town library was getting rid
of books—massive heaps of books lay scattered willy-nilly on long tables
with a sign—TAKE ANYTHING YOU WANT—FREE. Why? I asked the
librarian. What is wrong with these books? I stared at the library shelves.
They weren’t stuffed. We don’t want them, the librarian said. They are of no
use to us anymore. Does that mean no one checked them out for a while?
She shrugged, exhibiting no remorse. But a great sadness swept over me
and I began browsing. Hardbacks mostly—biographies, Adlai Stevenson
and Gandhi, novels, short stories, expeditions—mostly early- and mid-
twentieth century editions. Some had engraved-style covers and were even
older. I thought of my brother-in-law in New Zealand who collects and sells
books about adventure and I hiked straight down to the Dollar Store to buy
the most heavy-duty black trash bags available. Good thing I’d been
assigned to work in that town for a whole week.
Every day I visited the library and packed a bag with books, then hauled it
up the hill to where I was staying. I asked my hosts if I might leave the
books in the front hallway so I didn’t have to lug them all up the stairs—my
room was in the attic. They stared at me dubiously. I urged them to get
down to the library.
At the middle school where I was working, I pressed the writing students.
Hey people, you must get over to the library. Do it today. Great books are
sitting there free waiting for you to claim them. You won’t even have to
return them.
They stared at me. I never saw a single student at the library.
On Friday after school, I arrived to find the long tables gone. The librarian
pointed to the back door when she saw me. They’re outside now, she said.
A mountain of lovely books lay on the ground behind the library, recklessly
pitched.
I felt dizzy, sick. Marched back inside.
What happens to them next?
They go to the town dump.
My brain was whirling. Was there a criminal code for this?
The next day my husband would return from his own work in Canada to
collect me and drive home to Texas. He would be shocked to see how my
baggage had grown.
One of the books I took home with me was about a 1920s man who walked
alone across Africa, something my bookseller brother-in-law had also done.
This would be a perfect present for him. Later I heard he sold that book,
that slightly tattered book with the empty library card pocket still inside its
cover (which they say reduces the value), for $500.
I mailed a letter to my friend Howard Peacock, who liked to strut by the
river between our dwellings, staring into water, meditating on turtles and
cranes. Howard had a long white beard and a deeply southern, elegant way
of speaking. He rented a small apartment in the Granada, an old downtown
building which used to be a hotel. Howard gave me his dead wife’s
casserole cookbook, which I never used because it was mostly meat. But I
wanted to thank him, so mailed him a letter. I could just have walked down
to the river and handed it to him. I also thanked him for saving the Big
Thicket in east Texas which everyone said he and his late wife had fairly
singlehandedly preserved, throwing themselves down in front of bulldozers,
and a good thing, because those forests are profound and precious like all
great things people struggle to preserve. He never mentioned my letter till
five years had passed and he called. Did you write me a letter five years
ago?
Uh, I think so. Maybe. Why? I got it today. Nearly five years to the day
since you wrote it. Seriously. I’m mailing the envelope back to you right
now as proof. It had taken my letter five years to travel six blocks.
I carried the envelope with both our addresses on it to the post office and
asked the clerk, Do you have any idea where this letter might have been for
five whole years? The clerk gazed at me with his deep sad eyes and said,
Nope. It could have been anywhere.
Your parents met each other. Anybody met anybody.
Out of all the possible people who might have been born, you were born.
Constant miracles. But who remembers them?
Before the great film critic Roger Ebert died, he said, I believe I was
perfectly all right before I was born and I think I’ll be fine later too.
We walk around the block, stride up the hillside. Is it this year or last?
Something strange is happening. We’re so anxious but deep down, in the
heart place of time, our lives are resonant, rolling. They’re just waiting for
us to remember them. They are very patient and quiet. We are here, so
deeply here, and then we won’t be.
And it is the most unbelievable thing of all.
Airport Life
Loudspeaker announcement (San Antonio, Texas)
Attention in the terminal!
Would the passenger
who left a bucket of stones
with a candle stuck in them
please
return to
the security
checkpoint?
My shock—sitting at A3—I am the only one laughing.
Businessmen aren’t laughing.
They didn’t even hear it.
Repeat announcement . . .
Everyone looks bored. They are checking their phones.
They are telling people where they are.
Man on cell phone (Jeddah, Saudi Arabia)
Good-bye! Bye-bye, my sweethearts!
Love you!
Send email! Send pictures! Don’t forget!
Pray, do everything!!!!!
And take care!
Texas, Out Driving
The Solid Rock Church of Kerrville
has moved to another location.
It says so on the sign under the name—Solid Rock.
Also the entire town of Comfort
appears to be for sale.
This does not feel comforting at all.
How many times we drove these curves,
pale fence posts, bent cedars . . .
but nothing needs us here.
Nothing we said, thought, forgot,
took root in the ditch around the bend.
I always want to stop at historic markers,
see what happened long before, but
the pull of motion keeps a car going,
passing by till next time,
which soon won’t come,
even when everything we know
says slow.
Missing the Boat, Take Two
We sat on a long wooden pier,
waiting for a boat for one full hour.
Stared at gentle wavelets,
chatted with a sailor,
read about Maine,
reminisced.
Then the boat sneaked in so quietly,
pulled up at a slant behind our backs,
loaded passengers,
we never turned our heads into the sun to see,
the boat slipped away from the dock,
we were shocked.
I hope dying could feel like this.
All We Will Not Know
For Adriana Corral
Before dawn, trembling in air down to the old river,
circulating gently as a new season
delicate yet in its softness, rustling raiment
of hopes never stitched tightly enough to any hour.
I was almost, maybe, just about, going to do that.
A girl’s thick hair, brushed over one shoulder
so often no one could imagine it not being there.
Hair as a monument. Voice as a monument.
Hovering—pitched.
Beloved sister, maker of plans, main branch,
we need you desperately, where have you gone?
Here is the sentence called No no no no no.
Come back, everything grants you your freedom,
Here in the mire of too much thinking,
we drown, we drown, split by your echo.
Loving Working
“We clean to give space for Art.”
—Micaela Miranda, Freedom Theatre, Palestine
Work was a shining refuge when wind sank its tooth
into my mind. Everything you love is going away,
drifting, but you could sweep this stretch of floor,
this patio or porch, gather white stones in a bucket,
rake the patch for future planting, mop the counter
with a rag. Lovely wet gray rag, squeeze it hard,
it does so much. Clear the yard of blowing bits of
plastic.
The glory in the doing. Breath of the doing.
Sometimes the simplest move kept fear from
fragmenting into no energy at all, or sorrow from
multiplying, or sorrow from being the only person
living in the house.
Stars Over Big Bend
Maybe we first met this arching dome
in dreams of what a life could be.
Sheer spaciousness, before hope
bent backward too many times,
breaking news breaking us.
In the vast immensity
a breath feels more at home,
released into place.
Never mind which star might be dead,
how long ago it died—
don’t want to know.
Light taking forever to get here,
more precious when it arrives.
Far-ranging, brilliance to quietude,
legacies of patience, belonging, disappearing.
And if the stars do not remember us, they act otherwise.
United
When sleepless, it’s helpful to meditate
on mottoes of the states.
South Carolina, “While I breathe I hope.”
Perhaps this could be
the new flag on the empty flagpole.
Or “I Direct” from Maine—
Why, because Maine gets the first sunrise?
How bossy, Maine!
In Arkansas, “The People Rule.” Lucky you.
Kansas, “To the Stars Through Difficulties”—
clackety wagon wheels, long land
and the droning press of heat—cool stars, relief.
Idaho, “Let it be perpetual”—now this is strange.
Idaho, what is your “it”?
Who chose these lines?
How many contenders?
What would my motto be tonight, in tangled sheets?
Texas, “Friendship”—now boasts the Open Carry
law.
Wisconsin, where my mother’s parents are buried,
chose “Forward.” Washington, wisest, “By and By.”
New Mexico, “It Grows as It Goes”—
now this is scary.
Two dangling “its.” This does not represent
that glorious place.
West Virginia, “Mountaineers are always free”—really?
Oklahoma must be tired, “Labor conquers all things.”
Oklahoma, get together with Nevada, who chose only “Industry” as motto.
I think of Nevada as a playground,
or mostly empty. How wrong we are
about one another.
For Alaska to pick “North to the Future”
seems odd. Where else are they going?
Reserved for Poets
(Signs on first rows of chairs at poetry festival, La Conner, Washington)
Sunsets.
Trouble.
Full moons.
No really—they’re everybody’s.
Nothing is reserved.
We’re all poets rippling with
layers of memories,
mostly what we might forget.
Let it belong. Every pocket,
satchel, hand.
We forgot to make a reservation.
But there’s room.
Her Father Still Watching
For Doris Duke, whose father’s last words were said to have been “Trust no one”
You can trust me, said white marble
Trust us more, said black volcanic rocks
The palm tree said, I deserve nothing but trust
And the clouds drifting swiftly
said nothing but held
their trust sacred
Small Basket of Happiness
It would never call your name.
But it would be waiting somewhere close,
perhaps under a crushed leaf
turned from pale green to gold
with no fanfare.
You hadn’t noticed
the gathered hush
of a season’s tipping.
Shadows flowing past
before any light came up,
people whom only a few
might remember,
so much accompaniment
inside a single breeze.
All whom we loved.
In the quiet air lived
the happiness they had given.
And would still give, if only.
You would slow down a minute.
You would bend.
The tiny journalist
will tell us what she sees.
Document the moves, the dust,
soldiers blocking the road.
Yes, she knows how to take a picture
with her phone. Holds it high
like a balloon. Yes, she would
prefer to dance and play,
would prefer the world
to be pink. It is her job to say
what she sees, what is happening.
From her vantage point everything
is huge—but don’t look down on her.
She’s bigger than you are.
If you stomp her garden
each leaf expands its view.
Don’t hide what you do.
She sees you at 2 a.m. adjusting your
impenetrable vest.
What could she have
that you want? Her treasures,
the shiny buttons her grandmother loved.
Her cousin, her uncle.
There might have been a shirt …
The tiny journalist notices
action on far away roads
farther even than the next village.
She takes counsel from bugs so
puffs of dust find her first.
Could that be a friend?
They pretended not to see us.
They came at night with weapons.
What was our crime? That we liked
respect as they do? That we have pride?
She stares through a hole in the fence,
barricade of words and wire,
feels the rising fire
before anyone strikes a match.
She has a better idea.
Moon over Gaza
I am lonely
for my friends.
They liked me,
trusted my coming.
I think they looked up at me
more than other people do.
I who have been staring down so long
see no reason for the sorrows humans make.
I dislike the scuffle of bombs blasting
very much. It blocks my view.
A landscape of grieving
feels different afterwards.
Different sheen from a simple desert,
rubble of walls, silent children who once said
my name like a prayer.
Sometimes I am bigger than
a golden plate,
a giant coin,
and everyone gasps.
Maybe it is wrong
that I am so calm.
Exotic Animals, Book for Children
Armadillo means
“little armored one.”
Some of us become this to survive
in our own countries.
I would like to see an armadillo
crossing the road.
Our armor is invisible,
it polishes itself.
We might have preferred to be
a softer animal, wouldn’t you?
With fur and delicate paws,
like an African Striped Grass Mouse,
also known as Zebra Mouse.
Janna
At 7, making videos.
At 10, raising the truth flag.
At 11, raising it higher,
traveling to South Africa,
keffiyah knotted on shoulders,
interviews in airports.
Please, could you tell us …
You know gazing into a camera
can be a bridge, so you stare
without blinking.
People drift to the sides of the film,
don’t want to be noticed,
put on the spot.
You know the spot is the only thing
that matters.
What else? Long days,
tired trousers pinned
on roof lines,
nothing good expected.
It’s right in front of me,
I didn’t go looking for it.
We’re living in the middle of trouble.
No reason not to say it straight.
They do not consider us equal.
They blame us for everything,
forgetting what they took,
how they took it.
We are made of bone and flesh and story
but they poke their big guns
into our faces
and our front doors
and our living rooms
as if we are vapor.
Why can’t they see
how beautiful we are?
The saddest part?
We all could have had
twice as many friends.
Separation Wall
When the milk is sour,
it separates.
The next time you stop speaking,
ask yourself why you were born.
They say they are scared of us.
The nuclear bomb is scared of the cucumber.
When my mother asks me to slice cucumbers,
I feel like a normal person with fantastic dilemmas:
Do I make rounds or sticks? Shall I trim the seeds?
I ask my grandmother if there was ever a time
she felt like a normal person every day,
not in danger, and she thinks for as long
as it takes a sun to set and says, Yes.
I always feel like a normal person.
They just don’t see me as one.
We would like the babies not to find out about
the failures waiting for them. I would like
them to believe on the other side of the wall
is a circus that just hasn’t opened yet. Our friends,
learning how to juggle, to walk on tall poles.
Dareen Said Resist
And went to jail.
We were asking, What?
You beat us with butts of guns
for years,
tear-gas our grandmas,
and you can’t take
Resist?
In Northern Ireland They Called It “The Troubles”
What do we call it?
The very endless nightmare?
The toothache of tragedy?
I call it the life no one would choose.
To be always on guard,
never secure,
jumping when a skillet drops.
I watch the babies finger their
cups and spoons and think
they don’t know yet.
They don’t know how empty
the cup of hope can feel.
Here in the land of tea and coffee
offered on round trays a million times
a day, still a thirst so great
you could die every night, longing
for a better life.
How Long?
The tiny journalist
is growing taller very quickly.
She’s adding breadth, depth,
to every conversation,
asking different questions, not just
Who What When Where Why?
but How long? How can it be?
What makes this seem right to you?
Even when she isn’t present,
she might be taping from the trees.
What happened to you in the twentieth century?
Remember? We never forgot about it. You did.
Rounded up at gunpoint, our people
brutally beaten, pummeled in prisons,
massacred for a rumor of stones.
Once there was a stuffed squash
who didn’t wish to be eaten.
Kousa habibti, pine nuts for eyes.
I dreamed about her when I was five.
She helped me start my mission.
For Palestine
In memory, Fr. Gerry Reynolds of Belfast, “Let us pray for
Palestine”
How lonely the word PEACE is becoming.
Missing her small house under the olive trees.
The grandmothers carried her in a bucket when
they did their watering.
She waited for them in the sunrise,
then fell back into reach. Whole lives unfolded.
The uncles tucked her into suit coat pockets
after buttoning white shirts for another day.
Fathers, mothers, babies
heard her whispering in clouds over Palestine,
mingling softly, making a promise,
sending her message to the ground.
It wasn’t a secret.
Things will calm down soon, she said.
Hold your head up. Don’t forget.
When Ahed went to prison, we shook
our tired hands in the air and wept.
Young girl dreaming of a better world!
Don’t shoot her cousins, my cousins, our cousins.
Wouldn’t you slap for that?
It was only a slap.
The word Peace a ticket elsewhere for some.
People dreamed night and day of calmer lives.
Maybe Peace would be their ticket back too.
They never threw away that hope. Karmic wheel,
great myth of fairness kept spinning …
I dreamed of Ahed’s hair.
When I was born, they say
a peaceful breeze lilted the branches—
my first lullaby. The temperature dropped.
A voice pressed me forward,
told me to speak.
Being raised in a house of stories with garlic
gave me courage.
Everything began, Far, far away. Long, long ago.
And everything held us close.
Is this your story, or mine?
Olive oil lives in a dented can with a long spout.
What happens to Peace when people fight?
(She hides her face.)
What does she dream of?
(Better people.)
Does she ever give up?
Sometimes she feels very lonely on the earth.
She wants to walk openly with children.
Live the way they might.
Have a party with white cookies on simple plates.
Lots of them.
Nuts chopped fine.
She wants everyone to share.
Small People
Janna says the camera is stronger than the gun.
“I can send my message to small people
and they send it to others.”
Sun improving consciousness.
Wind ruffling discomfort.
Janna, we are small indeed.
Weighing the word “dream”
as it slips through midnight air.
Small people keeping it alive.
Help us ride on every train
to better history. Weighing
“fog” and “suitcase,” weighing “tomorrow”—
before we know two words in this life,
we’re already missing
what already left.
Women in Black
I would be one when I grew up.
Hovering, so watchful outside
government buildings, black T-shirts,
black jackets and scarves and gowns—
till then I am a girl in stripes.
They hold a belief—we could all
get along—Arabs, Jews, Swedes,
people with candles, or without.
Even if taunted or hit by stones,
rubber bullets,
we would keep watching,
No Violence!
No War! Trying to be more like
the peaceful village oasis,
Wahat al-Salaam, Nevi Shalom—
half-and-half everything,
school administrators, village counselors,
grocers, gardeners, kids, founded by
a Christian Brother,
why couldn’t all villages be like that?
What is wrong with us?
I flip the pages of the tattered Benetton catalogue
my friend’s mother still keeps in a drawer—
from before we were born,
Arabs and Jews as true friends
on every page, real people
telling their stories, you could not tell which
is which—aren’t there more?
Surely there are more. Red plastic chairs
sitting outside stone and stucco houses,
waiting for us. Waiting for us to sit together.
A project called UNHATE vs. guns.
Which would you choose?
But look how many guns!
Who did this to us?
Money? Guilt?
People in other countries did this to us?
Some people carrying guns look 12 years old.
My father always told me beware of righteousness.
If you are too right, everyone else is wrong.
Illegal settlements creep up the hills at night
erasing our old villages. Boxy white houses
with red roofs marching toward
our old stone terraces. Would you like that?
Americans, would you?
Women in Black don’t carry brooms
but I want them to sweep away our pain.
Here by the hills where angels once appeared,
my mother heard of a journalist who answered
How to solve this dilemma?
by saying, Put everything in the hands of women!
Women in black, women in white.
The men had their chance and failed.
Sure, a few women like Golda
said Palestinians didn’t exist—
she must have had bad eyesight.
So many voices without a chance yet.
Mine, for example.
It is our turn now.
And That Mysterious Word Holy
You might as well take a rotten lemon,
squeeze it in your hand.
Let the juice trickle down your wrist and arm,
sharp bite of acidity prickling your
scratches and scars and say,
I bow down to you.
When the almond tree erupts into
blossom without help from any people—
I bow down. Here we are in the land
of sacred story, chant, shrines,
altars and grottoes, parables,
and soldiers in camouflage are carrying guns.
What does that say about holy?
How much power it doesn’t have—
Thou shalt not kill crumpled under our feet.
Whose religion would you follow?
And why do they wear camouflage?
We can still see them.
Who are they hiding from?
The guns are bigger than we are.
The tanks are bigger than shrines.
Tear gas canisters, grenade casings
littering graves of our ancestors in the cemetery.
I bow down. You bow to the big shining platter
everyone eats off together. Sit in a circle
for your holy rice. Speak after me.
Holy eggplant, my best angel.
Netanyahu
You don’t need a periscope
or a microscope
to see another human being
guiding a child
hand on shoulder of child
arranging coverlet over sleeping child—
You don’t need a stethoscope
to imagine a heartbeat.
What does it mean when one person thinks
others deserve nothing?
What is that called?
If you know what it is called, why keep
doing it?
You don’t need a skewer for broiling
or a paring knife for seeing inside.
Studying English
COURAGE
has age
in it
but I say
age is not required.
A man from Scotland came to visit,
brought us square, buttery cookies,
repeated Steady at the tiller,
when he wandered our streets.
I had to search for the
meaning. Keeping control
of a situation, staying firm,
phrase often used in seafaring context,
though we have no boats, no rudders,
but originally the phrase connected to
a felled tree, of which we have plenty.
Losing as Its Own Flower
What if we had just said, OK we lose.
How would they have treated us then?
I ask my people, they gasp,
and all have different answers.
No, no, we can never give up.
Stay strong, keep speaking truth.
Truth unfolds in the gardens,
massive cabbages, succulent tomatoes,
orange petals billowing,
even when the drought is long.
Hang on tightly to what we have,
though just a scrap.
The ancestors would be ashamed
if we gave up. The invaders said our land
was barren and sad.
They said we were anti-Semitic.
But we were Semites too.
What could we do?
Giving up is different from losing.
In a way, we did lose. Where is everybody?
Scattered around the world like pollen.
Disappeared into the sunset.
Mingling with other cultures
in the great bubbling stew of the world.
See, we are good at that, why couldn’t we
have done better with our invaders?
They came pretending we were
an alien species. Said they had deep ties here,
some of them did, but what about ours?
Why couldn’t we all have ties?
They said God said.
(Always trouble.)
We replied, See the stone stoop of my house
with my rubbed footprints in it
after all these years?
See my shining key?
They said we made everything up.
We were crazy.
Is losing worse than being called crazy?
So we did lose. We lost our rhythm of regular living.
You want the page to be clean.
The day wide open, nobody suffering.
We lost our bearings, their voices
blew hard on us, trying to erase,
turning us inside out in their minds,
changing what we became.
Tried to make the world see us that way too.
We were the undeserving.
See what people do?
We could live up to their lies if
they made us crazy enough.
So we did lose.
Professors, educated students, best maker of maklouba,
math students of Gaza, embroiderers of the West Bank,
lemon vendors, grapefruit-growers,
artist who stayed in her room painting egg cartons
for so many days, where are you?
(She went to Italy.)
I too dream of Italy, France, Greece.
A village climbing a hill
where I’m not always looking back
over my shoulder,
eyes aren’t tipping to the sides
to catch approaching tanks and jeeps,
but this is my job.
Before speech, a baby makes a cat-cry.
Maybe I knew even then.
To document. To pay attention.
We wore striped T-shirts, they wore camouflage.
To be with my family on our ground.
If you live like a real human being—
that is the issue. Not winning and hunting others.
Not dominating.
Not sending your sewage their direction.
Did you know? Did you know they do this?
Not just refusing to lose.
Pink
The grandfather said he wouldn’t die
and then he died
which is why
I am staring so hard into the sunset
Mothers Waiting for Their Sons
One boy on the horizon.
A boy is a mountain.
Mother waiting for the moment
when his face comes into sight.
He’s dubious about so much hugging now
but the hands, clutched together,
mother and son, still a perfect fit.
Like a mountain when you sit on it.
“ISRAELIS LET BULLDOZERS GRIND TO
HALT”
American newspaper headline on the Internet
As if the bulldozers had their own lives
and were just being bulldozers
crushing houses
schoolrooms
clinics
art galleries
whole worlds
on their own time
no people involved.
“Deadline for Demolition”
as if cruelty had its own calendar
a banker or a businessman.
I am mad about language
covering pain
big bandage
masking the wound
let let let
but underneath
the hot blood clotting.
Harvest
The American doctors come to see
what we are living through when we pick olives.
They stand as witnesses, in circles in the grove.
They help hold the ladders.
The doctors say they are shocked to see.
We don’t know what it would feel like,
not having guns pointed at us. Guns
have been pointed at us all our lives.
America, don’t act surprised, you bought them!
Just tell us how to be a farmer, with guns.
Or celebrate a birthday, with guns.
No guns invited!
The doctors say they will go home and tell
what they experienced. Their kindness is
a balm. Don’t people know already?
Where is that news?
Some say Israel would be happiest
if we just disappeared. Like in a magic show?
Our magic is that we are
still here and were always here.
Shadow
Some people feel lost inside their days.
Always waiting for worse to happen.
They make bets with destiny.
My funniest uncle gave up cursing bad words
inside his head. He says he succeeded
one whole hour. He tried to unsubscribe to
the universe made by people. He slept outside
by himself on top of the hill.
When Facebook says I have “followers”—
I hope they know I need their help.
Subscribe to plants, animals, stars,
music, the baby who can’t walk yet but
stands up holding on to the sides of things,
tables, chairs, and takes a few clumsy steps,
then sits down hard. This is how we live.
Dead Sea
You could call it a friend, holding you
in its salty palm, letting you feel lighter
on the planet thanks to salt, playing its
joke. I love its somber gray sheen,
its loneliness. It might have preferred
to be a cool wave, an icy Arctic lake,
or the burbling spring my grandmother listened to
her whole childhood before the settlers
drained it off from us. She says the spring
had secrets and knew where jewels were,
in a house nobody lived in, and only children
would ever find the key.
Tattoo
When I hear about “forgotten people” I think,
they are not forgotten by me.
I knew the man down the alley by the market
who dragged his leg. He was out there, smoking,
almost my whole life.
His blue tattered pants,
the small denim pouch like a pocket
around his neck.
It didn’t make sense,
but he was always smiling,
if you nodded at him, or not,
chattering words to
a patience prayer, over and over.
It sounded more like Aramaic than Arabic.
He seemed happier to drag somewhere,
the short stone wall under the trees,
than people who find it easy to get there.
On his arm, the tattoo of a skinny blue moon.
He said it was the moon people like least
so he was going to like it most. Fingernail
flicker, little boat, holy symbol
without the star. Are you going to get a tattoo?
he used to tease the kids. We all said, No!
But he is tattooed on my mind
since he disappeared.
He rises in the darkest sky.
Sometimes There Is a Day
Sometimes there is a day you just want
to get so far away from.
Feel it shrink inside you like an island,
as if you were on a boat.
I always wish to be on a boat.
Then, maybe, no more fighting
about land. I want that day to feel
as if it never happened, when Ahmad was burned,
when people were killed, when my cousin was shot.
The day someone went to jail
is not a day that shines.
I want to have a clear mind again,
as a baby who stares at the light
wisping through the window and thinks,
That’s mine.
Advice
My friend, dying, said do the hard thing first.
Always do the hard thing and you will have a better day.
The second thing will seem less hard.
She didn’t tell me what to do when everything seems hard.
America Gives Israel Ten Million Dollars a Day
In jail:
Lama Khater has a two-year-old. She is not allowed to
write about politics and has been detained
7 times. The Israeli jail won’t let her sleep.
Salah Hamouri is French/Palestinian, a lawyer,
detained without charges or trial for more than a year.
His house was invaded three days after he passed the bar.
Party for justice!
Mustapha Awad, Belgian artist and dancer, was crossing
the border from Jordan to visit his family’s properties
when he was seized. Travel at your leisure! He does not
have a Palestinian ID.
We should all be concerned about Mohammed Zayed,
returned to prison after already serving a 19-year sentence.
No details on his new arrest, but said to be unrelated
to his first jailing. Wearing a black and white striped
French-style T-shirt in his photo, he is a Palestinian citizen
of Israel since 1948. He must be exhausted.
Who you are, exactly, or what you have been doing
all these years appears to be of little interest to Israeli
authorities when they jail you. It could be nothing.
It could be a word in a poem. Or the hand of a girl
slapping a soldier who just shot her cousin.
Wouldn’t you slap him too?
Israel receives 38 billion dollars from the United
States to comfort them. Why would they care who you are?
People are jailed for pitching a stone.
Malak Mattar, a young painter of extraordinary promise,
cannot travel to France or the UK to see her exhibited work.
She knows people in those places would have welcomed her.
But some people do not want Palestinians
to “lead normal lives.”
What do people in power really think about young artists?
Do they know they exist? Are artists ever normal?
And Yousef, how dare you wish to go to school?
Why should you involve yourself with student activities?
How dare you major in Electrical Engineering?
Yousef is now banned from entering
his campus. His family is “tense and frustrated.”
They had already paid his fees.
I asked a rabbi demonstrating against us
if his people could imagine our sorrows.
Could they just hold their own thoughts for a moment
and imagine what we feel like?
He was quiet, staring at me.
I made a rabbi quiet.
Could he imagine the pain of the boy Ahmad Dawabsha,
only survivor of his family terribly burned
when the settlers threw a Molotov cocktail into
his house? No more mother, father, baby brother,
Ahmad, once the most beautiful little boy you can imagine,
Ahmad, now alone with sorrow and scars and pain,
wrapping his wounds. And this is what
the rabbi said: I don’t know. I don’t know
if we can imagine it.
And that is the problem.
Gratitude List
Thank you for insulting me.
You helped me see how much I was worth.
Thank you for overlooking my humanity.
In that moment I gained power.
To be forgotten by the wider world
and the righteous religious
and the weaponized soldiers
is not the worst thing.
It gives you time to discover yourself.
Lemons.
Mint.
Almonds roasted and salted.
Almonds raw.
Pistachios roasted and salted.
Cheese.
It Was or It Wasn’t
Arabic fairy tales begin this way,
so do Arabic days.
A pantry is empty
but Mama still produces a tray of tea and cookies
for the guest.
West is still the way we stare—
knowing there’s blue space and free water
over there. There’s a Palestinian and a Jew
building a synagogue together in Arkansas.
They’re friends, with respect.
Actually our water
isn’t free either
nor are the fish my friends in Gaza
aren’t allowed to catch.
It was or it wasn’t a democracy,
a haven
for human beings,
but only some of them.
You can’t do that with people,
pretend they aren’t there.
It was or it wasn’t a crowd.
Diploma, marriage, legacy,
babies being born,
children being killed,
it was or it wasn’t going to work out.
Gaza Is Not Far Away
(Dr. Luke Peterson)
It’s in your cuffs.
The cup you just drank from.
Empty bucket outside back door with an inch of rain in it.
Sack of mulch to scatter on your winter beds.
Do you see these things as luxury?
It’s the crosswalk kids march in.
Mama with her yellow belt
waving them through. It’s rules.
It’s everything you keep a long time
in your refrigerator—pickles, tonic, apple butter.
Butter. The fact you have a refrigerator
and power to run it all day long.
Gaza might like that.
The world’s largest open-air prison keeps ticking day to day—
alarm clocks, kindergartens, spinach mixed into eggs,
little blue backpacks for kids,
a few filtered-water fountains, plastic bottles carried home,
and no, they can’t go swimming, can’t fish in their own sea,
can’t fly from their airport, can’t visit the so-called Holy City,
can’t do anything, basically, except be human, be humane.
They can go to the Book Club and read books.
And people far away won’t turn their heads to see
what Gaza is doing or how well they are doing it.
Or how hard it is.
Even when 500 people die from bombs they supplied.
They won’t cry because the dead ones weren’t someone
they knew and loved. Like the person sitting next to them
on the couch.
My Wisdom
When people have a lot
they want more
When people have nothing
they will happily share it
Some people say
never getting your way
builds character
By now our character must be
deep and wide as a continent
Africa, Australia
giant cascade of stars
spilling over our huge night
Where did the power go?
Did it enjoy its break?
Is power exhausted?
What is real power?
Who really has power?
Did the generator break?
Do we imagine silence
more powerful because
it might contain everything?
Quiet always lives
inside noise.
But does it get much done?
Silence waits
for truth to break it
Calendars can weep too
They want us to have better days
Welcome to every minute
Feel lucky you’re still in it
No bird builds a wall
Sky purse
jingling
change
Won’t give up
our hopes
for anything!
Not your fault
You didn’t make the world
How dare this go on and on?
cried the person who believed in praying
God willing God willing God willing
There were others who prayed
to ruins & stumps
Open palms
hold more
Refuse to give
mistakes
too much power
Annoying person?
Person who told me to stay home
and do what other girls do?
If you disappeared
I still might miss you
Babies want to help us
They laugh
for no reason
Pay close attention to
a drop of water
on the kitchen table
You cannot say one word about religion
and exclude Ahmad
Each Day We Are Given So Many Gifts
I did it
I made friends with a fly
Yawn a little pause
relighting breath
Blink a break
from sun’s sharp gaze
Yesterday evening after rain
the world tiled rosy
such a brief slip of minutes
as if someone got her wish
we could live in pink hold a shining note
release someone else’s anger
Jerusalem
Not your city—
everyone’s city.
Not my city—
everyone’s city.
City of time—
holding time.
Deeper than time.
Time’s true city.
Missing It
Our cousin Sami said at night when he can’t sleep
he thinks about everything he missed that day.
Which way didn’t he turn his head?
Whose face didn’t he notice?
He gets the answer to the problem he missed
on the test. He finally remembers where they buried
the one cat who sat in anyone’s lap.
A Person in Northern Ireland
Sends me a message with a quote
from Rainer Maria Rilke, a German poet:
“And now let us believe
in a long year that is given to us, new, untouched, full of
things that have never been.”
That’s sort of what I’m afraid of.
38 Billion
It’s hard to grasp very big numbers and distant concepts.
Like imagining what all our thoughts might have been
if we lived 300 years ago. Would they be centered
on a goat or six rocks piled together
or would they be wide as they are now?
In those long-ago days,
would people be meaner to one another
or nicer? I have no idea. But sometimes I wonder what
38 billion dollars could buy, instead of weapons aimed
against us and this is what comes to mind:
Eggs. Pencils. Undershirts of very soft cotton.
Ribbons. Radios. Shining flashlights.
Handmade clay plates. Chocolates. Really soft pillows.
Baskets. Bracelets. Running shoes.
Better Vision
In Ramallah, optical stores polish their glittering windows
and wait patiently, stocking shiny displays,
curatives for nearsighted, farsighted, astigmatism,
too much sun. My mother’s eye swells from allergy.
Mabrook! to ourselves in the round mirrors
when suddenly the world looks sharper.
Or Tikkun Olam, as our Hebrew-speaking
brothers and sisters might say, repair for the world,
see close, see far, see how similar we are,
or could be, if the hatchets weren’t hanging over
half our heads. Tarifi Optical, “rest your eyes from the rays,”
we’d rather rest our eyes from people who can’t see us.
I’ll take wide angle please, give me the whole horizon,
citizens of magnificent olive tones, curly-headed, braided,
kaftans, grandma gowns, exercise shirts, cotton dresses,
people holding hands like a children’s book,
standing on the globe,
round as a floating pupil.
Tarifi Optical invites us to “swap inelegant squinting”—
I love their words, maybe I could be an optician,
focused on better sight for all, and work at the Ottica shop,
“premier inspiration destination”
for top brands of eyeglasses in the West Bank,
did you know we have such things?
People think of us differently.
We may be in prison, but we still love beauty.
We may be oppressed, but we are smart.
We may think we don’t need glasses, but the big E
for equality has been lying on its back
for a long time now
kicking its legs in the air like an animal
that needs help to get up.
The Space We’re In
echoes deeply
Time doesn’t just crumple
the minute you turn the calendar page
I’m not sure about a country being great
I don’t know what that means
It sounds like bragging or more weapons
I want a country to be nice to all people
Make them feel better
than people feel by themselves
Compassionate and gentle
I want people to
move more slowly
pay better attention
share what they have
In the old Palestinian tradition
everyone was invited in
Sit down, coffee or tea?
Mint in your tea?
Dates?
even if you didn’t know the visitor
America being mean to Palestine
is nothing new
reminds me of
the dark side of junior high school
those who think you can have
only one best friend
usually end up
lonely
No Explosions
To enjoy
fireworks
you would have
to have lived
a different kind
of life
EVERYTHING CHANGES

Facebook Notes
Many say to Janna, Take care of yourself.
We are praying for you. Janna, you are so brave.
You run outside, our spirits go with you.
Others say you are too young to do this on your own.
Pushed forward as mouthpiece. You have charisma
so people use you as spokesperson. What’s wrong
with that? A senator from Planet Young? I’ll take
anyone but what we’ve got. Our letters to editors
trickled out for decades. What good did they do?
You are the witness, on-the-scene, microphone in
hand. You stand on the road to everywhere,
asking, What is this? What next?
We carry you with us wherever we go,
folded document of hope, unfolded flag,
unburdened alphabet, asking why.
Mediterranean Blue
If you are the child of a refugee, you do not
sleep easily when they are crossing the sea
on small rafts and you know they can’t swim.
My father couldn’t swim either. He swam through
sorrow, though, and made it to the other side
on a ship, pitching his old clothes overboard
at landing, then tried to be happy, make a new life.
But something inside him was always paddling home,
clinging to anything that floated—a story, a food, or face.
They are the bravest people on earth right now,
don’t dare look down on them. Each mind a universe
swirling as many details as yours, as much love
for a humble place. Now the shirt is torn,
the sea too wide for comfort, and nowhere
to receive a letter for a very long time.
And if we can reach out a hand, we better.
To Netanyahu
My Palestinian father named his donkey after you.
Yahu—everyone thought it was for the Internet,
but he knew. Now I think he insulted the donkey.
The donkey was friends with a horse, in a field.
They didn’t have much, but they shared it.
Pink flowers in spring—neither of them
tried to rule the field.
Your army just bombed a U.N. center for refugees.
Gaza, imprisoned in poverty for decades—
take that! More blood for supper.
Years since my father died,
his donkey still stands quietly
gazing from enormous eyes,
hanging his humble head.
Pharmacy
It stuns me to see the oldest man in the world buying shaving cream. He is
also buying shampoo and boxed cookies, square sand tarts, a sack of
chocolate peppermints. The amount of hope contained in these purchases,
considering his bowed posture, his pale suit, majestic movements, his cane
with a plastic coin purse attached near the handle, cannot be weighed. I
think of the ten-year-old journalist photographing a demonstration of her
people at home, shouting out bravely to the soldiers that threaten them, We
just want to be left alone on our land. What is wrong with being on our
land? And consider the terrain of this ancient man’s own American life.
Who walked it with him, who held his hand? Today he is by himself. He
will step out the automatic sliding doors of the pharmacy with great effort,
hauling his plastic sack of purchases, and step carefully into his car at the
special marked parking place, and drive away, ever so slowly. I don’t know
what the little girl will do.
My Father, on Dialysis
wrote a book about Palestine called
Does the Land Remember Me?
He wrote it in longhand on scraps of paper
as his blood filtered through the big machine
He was not afraid to watch it
circulate
Nurses and aides asked him
What are you doing?
He said, planting a garden
of almonds and figs
Dipping sprigs of mint into
glasses of steaming tea
Breathing the damp stones
of my old city
Pressing my mind into the soul
of an olive tree
Blood on All Your Shirts
Even your skinny ribbed undershirt
your favorite blue guayabera
A long life of travel ends in seepage
Holes in the skin
Difficult comebacks
The graft and the duct and the valve
Flirting with nurses a hopeful distraction
Maybe they’d prick you more kindly
If you listened to their marital woes
Telling how deft and lovely they were
How ruddy their cheeks
angelic their smiles
My Immigrant Dad, On Voting
As a journalist I copied down what candidates said
But I didn’t believe them
No hardly ever
If you paid attention
the people who got elected
always seemed to be crooks
after the election
Elections made me think though
At least we had them
At least people pretended
Once my friend ran for mayor and I felt excited
I know
I should have been more enthusiastic
Jimmy Carter was the only one I trusted
He saw us as human beings
He wasn’t afraid to say Apartheid which of course
it was and always has been
He got in trouble for being honest
I wrote him a letter
Said he was the best president I ever had
You Are Your Own State Department
Each day I miss Japanese precision. Trying to arrange things
the way they would. I miss the call to prayer
at Sharjah, the large collective pause. Or
the shy strawberry vendor with rickety wooden cart,
single small lightbulb pointed at a mound of berries.
In one of China’s great cities, before dawn.
Forever I miss my Arab father’s way with mint leaves
floating in a cup of sugared tea—his delicate hands
arranging rinsed figs on a plate. What have we here?
said the wolf in the children’s story
stumbling upon people doing kind, small things.
Is this small monster one of us?
When your country does not feel cozy, what do you do?
Teresa walks more now, to feel closer to her
ground. If destination within two miles, she must
hike or take the bus. Carries apples,
extra bottles of chilled water to give away.
Kim makes one positive move a day for someone else.
I’m reading letters the ancestors wrote after arriving
in the land of freedom, words in perfect English script …
describing gifts they gave one another for Christmas.
Even the listing seems oddly civilized,
these 1906 Germans … hand-stitched embroideries for dresser
tops. Bow ties. Slippers, parlor croquet, gold ring, “pretty
inkwell.”
How they comforted themselves! A giant roast
made them feel more at home.
Posthumous medals of honor for
coming, continuing—could we do that?
And where would we go?
My father’s hope for Palestine
stitching my bones, “no one wakes up and
dreams of fighting around the house”—
someday soon the steady eyes of children in Gaza,
yearning for a little extra electricity
to cool their lemons and cantaloupes, will be known.
Yes?
We talked for two hours via Google Chat,
they did not complain once. Discussing stories,
books, families, a character who does
what you might do.
Meanwhile secret diplomats are what we must be,
as a girl in Qatar once assured me,
each day slipping its blank visa into our hands.
Elementary
At the 100-year-old National Elk Refuge
near Jackson Hole, we might ask,
How long does an elk live?
Who’s an old elk here?
We’d like to spend time
with an elder elk please.
Tell us how to balance our lives
on this hard edge of human mean,
mean temperatures, what we do and don’t
want to mean.
Closing the door
to the news will only make you
stupid, snapped my friend
who wanted everyone to know as much
as she did. I’m hiding in old school books
with information we never used yet.
Before I drove, before I flew,
before the principal went to jail.
Sinking my eyes into tall wooden
window sashes, dreaming of light
arriving from far reaches,
our teachers as shepherds,
school a vessel of golden hope,
you could lift your daily lesson
in front of your eyes,
stare hard and think,
this will take me
somewhere. O histories of India,
geological formations of Australia,
ancient poetries of China, Japan,
someday we will be aligned in a place
of wisdom, together.
Red deer, wapiti, running elk rising
above yellow meadows at sundown.
An elk bows her head. In the company
of other elk, she feels at home.
And we are lost on the horizon now,
clumsy humanity,
deeper into the next century than we
can even believe,
and they will not speak to us.
On the Old Back Canal Road by the International
Hotel, Guangzhou
Janna, you are here too
everywhere
your curious thoughts
delicately constructed
You reside in every dream
of human rights
We breathe together
eating hummus made by Palestinians
where the green water weaves
between brick channels
stacked lives
laundry strung from balconies
geraniums popping red yeses
somewhere a radio playing
a very old song
three notes up and down
speaking to one another
inside the rounded mind
observatory
new and old harmonizing here
Everywhere I go
you’re like the bodyguard
our slim complaints
in such a vast world
(they thought I stole the pencil box
from my room—
I had just moved it)
but no one shouting
in front of my hotel
Begone!
Gray Road North from Shenzhen
Stretching, stretching.
Sober pavement, a fog of skyscrapers,
looming gray clouds. Not one moving human
visible outside. How loud the loneliness of workers
abandoning villages for the long shifts,
disappearing into factories,
brief breaks, stark apartments
where their second pair of gray pants waits.
Stun
Who’s remembering
Yemen had the most
amazing architecture
in the world?
Yemenis remember.
No one mentions this on the news.
Bomb explodes, bus
of schoolchildren.
Their glory also
unmentioned.
Sometimes I just call out to Dubai.
Dubai! I say. If you can build new
buildings like that,
can’t you help us?
We stood in the parking lot

I couldn’t remember how
to open a car door.
All I Can Do
“We have such a beautiful country, but it’s not been
utilized before for this kind of tourism …”
George Rishmawi, AramcoWorld
One hand out against the earth,
one hand up against the sky.
Somehow I walk between them.
They carry messages through my body,
on a cord stretched between far places.
What could have been, what might be …
Some days it’s all I can do
to stand still and answer you.
In Some Countries
There were people who had a hundred handbags.
People who hired maids to take care of their maids.
You could float down the Rhine and see castles.
Dogs wore coats for daily walks in Central Park.
A dog’s diamond collar glistened.
We were not dreaming of these things for ourselves.
We needed basics, starting small.
Hello, you look like a human being to me.
It’s hard to know what open roads mean
if you’ve always had them.
We can’t imagine
the luxury of open roads.
Seeing His Face
For Jaffar, in Dubai
When you said, first thing picking me up
at airport—If he wins, we would have to see his face,
hear his voice, that would be so bad for all of us—
we could still laugh. Day before election, 2016,
—surely this could not happen.
Next day, we reeled into a bright sky,
driving to a school, pummeled by morning news—
desperately you kept flicking radio stations
Arabic, English, Farsi, saying, I’m afraid
it just happened. How could it happen?
Shortly after, an Australian librarian
would pass me a note, WTF?
Small children gathering, notebooks, pencils,
how could I speak a word, now that my own country
took such a swerve? Little girls in dark uniform sweaters,
with buttons. Smiling up. Tell us where to begin.
Wales
Once a friend drove me from England into Wales for one hour’s visit and
that single hour was enough to suggest, for time immemorial, there are so
many ways in which America can never be first. Black and white cows,
nibbling gently between layered hillsides. Shocking radiance of green under
silent drifting poufs. Sheep dodging up a rise, leaping alongside lined white
stones. No wires, billboards, poles, not a scrap of rubbish, not a rubbish bin.
Two hikers with blue backpacks lounging in a meadow. Approaching a V in
the skinny one-lane pavement, my friend asked which way I wanted to turn.
How would I know? Was there a preferred way? He paused. No, it is
equally perfect every direction. Sorry, America. Who could say this about
you?

On the Birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King
Instead of Donald Trump, I will think of Dr. King’s dignity,
his resonant voice, conviction, inclusion.
Instead of Donald Trump, I will think of Steve Ng of New Mexico,
who brought personal handmade clay cups
from his home kitchen to a writing workshop at Ghost Ranch.
Otherwise we would have been drinking
from little disposable cups.
Steve carried in two cardboard boxes, set up a table,
arranged blue, gray, elegantly designed vessels in two rows.
Pick which one you like best.
The cups helped us feel cozier, as if Ghost Ranch
could really be our home for a week.
From Steve’s writing, one line:
If I have the time to watch the shadows along the trees move, I can say I
am satisfied.
False Alarm Hawai‘i
Heavy branches, orange tangerines. Emergency alert texted to telephones
throughout islands said, Take Cover. Missile has been launched. This is not
a drill. My husband was sitting north of Honoka‘a on Hawai‘i Island at a
table, doing his work. No television in the house. So he waited, confused.
Take cover? Dive under a chair? 40 minutes till they said, False Alarm. In
Gaza it is rarely a false alarm. It really happens. Later it is backpage news,
but the schools, clinics, art centers, people are destroyed. In Honolulu,
children were escorted down manholes. Hysterical students running hard
along beaten gray paths at university in Manoa. I love you, I love you!
Sometimes Hawai‘i misses itself, true self before strip centers and public
parking. It has everything it needs, but too many people want it now. Think
what could be annihilated in a few seconds and has been, before. Kids at the
American School in Tokyo distribute Hiroshima T-shirts before leaving on
their annual Hiroshima camping trip. Who could wear it? Who could sleep?
A Palestinian Might Say
What?
You don’t feel at home in your country,
almost overnight?
All the simple things
you cared about,
maybe took for granted …
you feel
insulted, invisible?
Almost as if you’re not there?
But you’re there.
Where before you mingled freely …
appreciated people who weren’t
just like you …
divisions grow stronger.
That’s what “chosen” and “unchosen” will do.
(Just keep your eyes on your houses and gardens.
Keep your eyes on that tree in bloom.)
Yes, a wall. Ours came later but …
who talks about how sad the land looks,
marked by a massive wall?
That’s not a normal shadow.
It’s something else looming over your lives.
Alien Rescue
For years I have loved the line: Elimination is the secret of
chic (Balenciaga) but in the case of one’s home being washed away by
mud, or storm, or Israeli bulldozer, this might not apply.
Poet Mei-mei Berssenbrugge wrote: “He says problems in Israel can be
solved by extra-terrestrials …”
Land here, friends. Welcome!
The Mount of Olives could use a new chapter in its story.
The thing which did not go right haunts from inside
like a splinter gained from swiping a hand
across the broken chair, in sorrow.
Chair carrying echoes.
Villages humming songs of the absent ones.
Please remember we too were rooting for things to be firm.
Why is that hard to imagine?
Anthony Bourdain made everyone come to the same table.
How loud the echo right before dawn.
Her voice a library of kindness.
I hear pages rustling, hungry fingers
moving through stories. If you were very alone,
you would want this voice to find you.
The Sweeper
They say she has moved to another village
to be with her cousins. Always we heard the rhythm
of brush, brush, the predictable swish of
a broom’s old hairs, the straw of continuing,
yes, yes, make it better, tired but still working,
morning and evening the sweep, the rustle,
how could it be such a soft thing helped our sanity?
Litter of leaves, branch bits gathering,
she did not say goodbye.
Arab Festival T-shirt
SEATTLE 2007. I wasn’t even there,
but wear this shirt proudly all the time.
Since when Arab Tragedy only? No!
Forgetting spread tables, smoky eggplant,
tiny spinach pies, punctuating pomegranate seeds,
neat almond in the center
of each rectangle of harissa,
since when we put down embroideries, joy,
birth certificates of stitching and knotting,
naming of constellations,
discovery of equations,
dancing with the handkerchief, oud and drum,
we will teach our children, guard our skeins
of blue and red thread,
refusing to forget laughter even if the world forgets
we ever have it
and this T-shirt with bright turquoise
and orange lettering on brave black says so.
One Small Sack in Syria
The vendor filled it fuller than it needed to be.
He wanted to make his shoppers happy.
He shook the roasted pistachios
redolent with charcoal and fire
into all corners of the brown paper bag
and smiled, folding the edge.
He said, Very good nuts.
Long road to Aleppo.
He said, Say hello to Aleppo.
Positivism
My friend in Gaza writes to me:
Gaza Strip is really so wonderful … regardless of the siege … the sea port,
the green fields, peaceful roads decorated with many red, pink, white and
orange flowering trees, decent people, elegant restaurants and hotels with
fascinating views … We wish … the crossing borders are always open where
we can travel freely and friends can come to visit us freely as well …
Fresh as a new notebook—that’s how anyone wanted to live.
Hopeful as a pencil sharpened,
clear as one beam of light landing on the table’s far side.
The children dove into a story and flew far away.
Even those who had never been to an airport
or seen a plane land at close range.
This was our superpower, retaining imagination
in worst days. They smiled shyly.
They expressed no blame.
Regret
To forgive ourselves for what we didn’t do
Replay a scene over and over in mind
Change it change
Apologizing to our own story handful of soil
I could have planted something better here
To walk without remembering another walk
To wash off the hope of a darkened day
Make a new one
This is normal here, the fathers say
bombs exploding
tourists stepping carefully over grenades
Excuse us this is not the life
we would have made or the way
we would have welcomed you
tear gas billowing over our streets
Regular

SOS
We are so tired
Salvation
Sitti’s hands fingering red and purple velvets,
soothed by nap, by softness, pulling yellow and orange floss
snugly through, till a calm bird rises from the stitches,
with a neat knotted eye
in such hard days.
The Old Journalist Talks to Janna
From beyond the trees
I appreciate your efforts.
I see you stand, hands up, saying
Move back! to the ones with guns.
This was never easy for me to do.
After seeing them kill my friend,
I feared them. I loved my life,
did not want my mother to grieve.
You are braver than I was.
His blood spilled over the bench
where we had been sitting.
It’s hard to describe how dust settles
but we all know it does.
How the bird returns to the nest
with no apology, the brother disappears
for decades, then says, I was never mad
at anyone, I was just hurt.
Words circulate like breezes in the evening
after a long hot day. I want to say,
Take care of yourself. We need you.
It is possible we have to be losers, dear Janna.
In the big picture who cares who won or lost?
I always thought about dignity, grace, truth.
I thought about enduring. Maybe losers
get to be taken care of!
The truth is we were so wronged and so forgotten
we had to become heroes to survive at all.
You speak the bell ringing, the wake up call,
and I am sending you the last scraps of energy
I had in my pockets when I died.
Grandfathers Say
Grandfathers say the garden is deep,
old roots twisted beyond our worry
or reach. Maybe our grief began there,
in the long history of human suffering,
where rain goes when it soaks out of sight.
Savory smoke from ancient fires
still lingers. At night you can smell it
in the stones of the walls.
When you awaken, voices
from inside your pillow
still holding you close.
The Old Journalist Writes …
From a notebook of Aziz Shihab
I heard my mother die.
After days of utter silence, she opened her dry toothless mouth and said,
“Aziz, let me kiss your hand. Take me on the road. Be with me on the
road.”
“What road?”
“It’s a narrow road. The lights are strong. Green doves are flying overhead.”
She said people were waiting for her on both sides of the road.
“Who are they?”
Her sister Masooda, her son, her sister Nafa, her daughter Naomi.
“But they are dead,” I said.
“No, here they are,” she said. “They are smiling.”
She opened her eyes wider.
“Do you see them?” I asked.
“I don’t see you, but I see them.” She shrieked, “Stop staring at me!”
“But I’m not staring at you,” I said.
“Not you. That man is staring at me, making fun of me. Go away, don’t
stare at me,” she said again.
“Who is he?”
“A very tall man. He’s pestering the little girl.”
“What girl?”
“I don’t know. But she is right here, sleeping next to me.”
Long silence.
“Aziz, my son,” she suddenly said. “Look at the grapevines.
They are loaded with sweet grapes.”
“Where?”
“Right here,” she said and smiled, looking up at the ceiling. “Right here.”
“Hanging from the ceiling?”
“Yes.”
“Hey, Masada!” she shouted. “Stay with me!”
“Were you friends with Masada before she died?”
“She didn’t die. Here she is. Say hello to your Aunt Masada.”
Two women came to the door of her room to visit her.
I invited them in, but she said, “No, I don’t want them! They
are not from my world.”
Silence. Long silence. I apologized to the women, escorted them out.
Then she fell asleep, mumbling to the little girl she said was beside her.
When she awakened she whispered, “Aziz, where are you?”
I told her I was next to her. I gently rubbed her forehead. She fell asleep
again.
In less than five minutes, she awakened. “Take me home, I beg you, take
me home!”
I told her she was home.
“Not this home! The one outside the gates. Right over the little shop.”
I said I didn’t know what she was talking about.
“Why not, son? What’s wrong with you? My home outside the gate. I beg
you take me home.”
I told her she was a little confused.
“Oh no, I never was confused. You are. Take me home.”
“Where are you now?”
“Out in the fields on the ground.”
“How do you want me to take you home?”
“I’m in the water tank. I am sitting in it. Just push it.”
“Does it have wheels?”
“Yes, and it is empty. Except for me.”
She lived one more year after this.
Friend
We walked through weeds.
Two bottles pitched outside his house, boarded,
UNSAFE notice tacked to the door.
He tied an engine to a trashcan, told me to drive it.
I did not.
You made us act in all your plays.
I did? Who wrote the plays?
You did.
Faded curtain costumes, clink of nickels in a hat.
We’re the old gang, we said to people staring.
This was our ’hood.
You’re old all right, and it ain’t no more!
Did you plant these huge leafdroppin’ trees?
We curse you!
Good job, I said to my invisible
tree-planting grandpa, walking away.
Castles, fortresses, cabins.
We took note of broken twigs.
We dreamed a bear, ancient animal
come to befriend. We never fought,
could not imagine wars.
No one ever built anything lasting in the woods
so the ditch remembered us best.
Happy Birthday
Older than old people now.
Older than the auntie in the bank,
I just come in here so someone
will say Good Morning to me. Older than
the shiny-headed Englishman
at the end of the table describing his journeys
so long ago, seriously he seems like Grandpa
and you are older than he.
Paint-peeling flowerpot tipping in the grass,
faded sign for EATS, birdseed store,
they have seeds for birds you never heard of
and will scoop it into brown paper sacks to weigh
on an old-fashioned scale. Older than the scale?
Down the street everything is changing.
Abandoned factories turning to lofts.
Junior’s Bar to a dental clinic.
No one cares for your opinion,
you are a rusted spike in a railroad track,
bundle of rotting leaves under the climbing rose.
Turn them under, over, be brave enough
to disappear as you promised you would
when you were young and clumsy
and strong as a roof.
Stay Afloat
What scraps we cling to these days—
giant slim stalk springing from the aloe pot,
upside-down pale orange bells
lasting for months.
Gift from the underworld.
Or Fareed Zakaria
resembling my father when I was young.
Gazing into the screen, please tell me
what is going on. Who are these strange people
we live among?
There are no olive trees or mint leaves
in their forest,
only looming bank vaults with locked drawers.
How much do they need?
Someone else will launch a bomb.
Children wake up smiling, to see their mothers killed.
How do they survive?
When I see the politicians’ faces
gazing stupidly with thin smiles
as if posing
for a shaving cream ad,
I lose my mind.
Find a child to be your leader now.
Follow him through rooms, notice
his delicate moves, delight in syllables, repeat.
Announcing the swish of every passing bus.
Bow down to his love.
Babies say, Mine, mine, but babies are kind.
The men on the screen, jaws tight,
can’t remember a single right thing to do.
To Sam Maloof’s Armchair
Sam, what if we could sit in your chair an entire day,
feel its gleaming grace pervade our skin and thoughts,
would we be changed? Your walnut found a sheen
deeper than memories of women and men. You used
hand tools, liked “clean flow.” When you dove
wholeheartedly into the slowness of labor’s long elegance,
perfection grew. But you called yourself a “woodworker”
because it was an “honest word.” The boy Sam spoke
Spanish and Arabic before English, lived among
California fruit trees, knew eight brothers and sisters.
People say you had elegant script, were always generous,
would describe to anyone how you did what you did.
A craftsman of “soul,” shaping low-slung arms a sitter
might fling legs over, still feeling comfortable, calm.
Even your hinges were wood. No dazzle, no frills,
you kept shaping tables, shelves, this honorable chair
we could vote for repeatedly, timeless presence dissolving
gloom. We close our eyes, try to live in your room.
Unforgettable
In the water is a poem
unwritten by grass.
No. In the land is a poem
unwritten by water.
Everything unwritten.
Not on your forehead,
not on the sky.
The fathers sailed away
planning to return.
Not easily will they forget
a place that let us all
sorrow this much.
Rumor Mill
I heard that far away in other countries,
Finland and China, ancient Palestinian men and women
fall asleep with their hands on their hearts and by now
their hearts are shaped just like old Palestine,
not the new cut-into-bits pockmarked map of places
we are allowed to live, but the whole stitchery of towns
with melodious names, Arimathea, Bethabara,
Cana, Tiberias, Nazareth, Beersheba, Magdala,
and when these people dream, their rooms fill
with the flute music our great grandfathers loved,
the ney, that you used to hear around fires
at dusk, rising notes in thin curls of smoke.
Goat cheeses leavened and clarified,
small white mountains on an old black tarp.
No one had to do anything right then
but be quiet, and listen. When they awaken,
after dreaming like that, it is easier for them
to go on living.
Patience Conversations
Why don’t they write about us more?
Our beauty overwhelms them.
Why can’t they hear our worlds echoing back and forth?
Song with doubled harmony. Ears closed.
Who wanted what?
We all love falafel.
Calling us anti-Semitic
when we are Semites too,
no joke, no one is laughing.
Why don’t they ask the right questions?
What’s hard for you? That’s hard for me too.
Why do they stare at us as if they never saw kids before?
Where are their memories?
Have they placed their memories in iron lock boxes
buried in the cement of the drainage ditch?
Do they see the kids who have to walk to school
through the drainage ditch?
Because they won’t let them cross the road?
Tell my story, tell my story.
Memory was always staring hard at itself
inside my head.
Does the wide world know there are two roads,
one for them and one for us? And ours isn’t good?
The wide world! Singing of the stable and the cows.
Donkey and kings. Wise men.
We would be so happy to meet.
Pothole, crack. Pothole, crack.
Where were the wise women?
Children circling, chanting in the shadow of the wall.
Small boy carrying broken candle
he found on the ground. Not even a wick left.
Doing the dust dance.
Kicking the foot.
We were waiting.
Living
On the last day of the world
I would want to plant a tree
—W. S. Merwin
Never wanted to think about
the last day of the world
Do these palms think about it?
That sea? Wedge of blue under blue?
You can’t be sure of anything now
Sound waves rolling
Finally understanding a phrase
Sitting on hillside in garden
You don’t have to say anything
for conversation to exist
Tiny Journalist Blues
Nothing to give you
that you would want.
Nothing big enough
but freedom.
BREAK MY HEART
There are always flowers,
Love cries, or blood.
Someone is always leaving
By exile, death, or heartbreak.
The heart is a fist.
It pockets prayer or holds rage.
It’s a timekeeper.
Music maker, or backstreet truth teller.
Baby, baby, baby
You can’t say what’s been said
Before, though even words
Are creatures of habit.
You cannot force poetry
With a ruler, or jail it at a desk.
Mystery is blind, but wills you
To untie the cloth, in eternity.
Police with their guns
Cannot enter here to move us off our lands.
History will always find you, and wrap you
In its thousand arms.
. . .
Someone will lift from the earth
Without wings.
Another will fall from the sky
Through the knots of a tree.
Chaos is primordial.
All words have roots here.
You will never sleep again
Though you will never stop dreaming.
The end can only follow the beginning.
And it will zigzag through time, governments, and lovers.
Be who you are, even if it kills you.
It will. Over and over again.
Even as you live.
Break my heart, why don’t you?
My grandfather Monahwee (also spelled “Menawa”), of some generations
back, was allowed to visit his home, at Okfuskee (near what is now known
as Dadeville, Alabama), to stay there one night before being exiled to the
West. He is reported to have said to “a highly reputable gentleman,” after
gifting him with his portrait:
“I am going away. I have brought you this picture—I wish you to take it and
hang it up in your house, that when your children look at it, you can tell them
what I have been . . . for when I cross the great river, my desire is that I may
never again see the face of a white man.”
After he left, he never turned back. He kept walking forward with his
beloved people.
I returned to see what I would find, in these lands we were forced to leave
behind.
EXILE OF MEMORY
Do not return,
We were warned by one who knows things
You will only upset the dead.
They will emerge from the spiral of little houses
Lined up in the furrows of marrow
And walk the land.
There will be no place in memory
For what they see
The highways, the houses, the stores of interlopers
Perched over the blood fields
Where the dead last stood.
And then what, you with your words
In the enemy’s language,
Do you know how to make a peaceful road
Through human memory?
And what of angry ghosts of history?
Then what?
. . .
Don’t look back.
In Sunday school we were told Lot’s wife
Looked back and turned
To salt.
But her family wasn’t leaving Paradise.
We loved our trees and waters
And the creatures and earths and skies
In that beloved place.
Those beings were our companions
Even as they fed us, cared for us.
If I turn to salt
It will be of petrified tears
From the footsteps of my relatives
As they walked west.
. . .
I did not know what I would find
The first night we set up our bed in the empty room
Of our condo above the Tennessee River
They’d heard we were coming
Those who continued to keep the land
Despite the imposition of newcomers
And the forced exile of our relatives.
All night, they welcomed us
All night, the stomp dancers
All night, the shell shakers
All night circle after circle made a spiral
To the Milky Way
. . .
We are still in mourning.
The children were stolen from these beloved lands by the government.
Their hair was cut, their toys and handmade clothes ripped
From them. They were bathed in pesticides
And now clean, given prayers in a foreign language to recite
As they were lined up to sleep alone in their army-issued cages.
. . .
Grief is killing us. Anger tormenting us. Sadness eating us with disease.
Our young women are stolen, raped and murdered.
Our young men are killed by the police, or killing themselves and each other.
. . .
This is a warning:
Heroin is a fool companion offering freedom from the gauntlet of history.
Meth speeds you past it.
Alcohol, elixir of false bravado, will take you over the edge of it.
Enough chemicals and processed craving
And you can’t push away from the table.
If we pay enough, maybe we can buy ourselves back.
. . .
We used to crowd the bar for Tuesday ten-cent beer night.
It was the Indian, poetry, biker and student bar
In that university and military base town.
Trays packed with small cups of beer passed nonstop
Over the counter all night.
We brought all of our thirsty dreams there
Gambled with them at the pool table, all night.
Danced with them and each other on the blood-stained dance floor
To jukebox songs fed by dimes and quarters, all night.
And by 2 A.M. we staggered out
To the world made by Puritan dreaming
No place for Indians, poets or any others who would
Ride the wild winds for dangerous knowledge.
All night.
. . .
In the complex here there is a singing tree.
It sings of the history of the trees here.
It sings of Monahwee who stood with his warrior friends
On the overlook staring into the new town erected
By illegal residents.
It sings of the Civil War camp, the bloodied
The self-righteous, and the forsaken.
It sings of atomic power and the rise
Of banks whose spires mark
The worship places.
The final verse is always the trees.
They will remain.
. . .
When it is time to leave this place of return,
What will I say that I found here?
From out of the mist, a form wrestled to come forth—
It was many-legged, of many arms, and sent forth thoughts of many colors.
There were deer standing near us under the parted, misted sky
As we watched, they smelled for water
Green light entered their bodies
From all leaved things they ate—
. . .
The old Mvskoke laws outlawed the Christian religion
Because it divided the people.
We who are relatives of Panther, Raccoon, Deer, and the other animals and
winds were soon divided.
But Mvskoke ways are to make relatives.
We made a relative of Jesus, gave him a Mvskoke name.
. . .
We could not see our ancestors as we climbed up
To the edge of destruction
But from the dark we felt their soft presences at the edge of our mind
And we heard their singing.
There is no word in this trade language, no words with enough power to hold
all this we have become—
. . .
We are in time. There is no time, in time.
We are in a traditional Mvskoke village, far back in time.
Ekvnvjakv is in labor, so long in time.
She is not young and beyond the time of giving birth.
The keeper of birthing is tracking her energy, and time.
My thinking is questioning how, this time.
. . .
A young boy wrestles with two puppies at the doorway.
A little girl, bearing an old woman spirit appears
With green plants in her hands.
Twins play around the edge of the bed.
Earth’s womb tightens with the need to push.
That is all that I see because of the fogginess of time.
. . .
I sing my leaving song.
I sing it to the guardian trees, this beloved earth,
To those who stay here to care for memory.
I will sing it until the day I die.
GRANDDAUGHTERS
I was a thought, a dream, a fish, a wing
And then a human being
When I emerged from my mother’s river
On my father’s boat of potent fever
I carried a sack of dreams from a starlit dwelling
To be opened when I begin bleeding
There’s a red dress, deerskin moccasins
The taste of berries made of promises
While the memories shift in their skins
At every moon, to do their ripening
THE FIGHT
The rising sun paints the feet
Of night-crawling enemies.
And they scatter into the burning hills.
I have fought each of them.
I know them by name.
From before I could speak.
I’ve used every weapon.
To make them retreat.
Yet they return every night
If I don’t keep guard
They elbow through openings in faith
Tear the premise of trust
And stick their shields through the doubt of smoke
To challenge me.
I grow tired of the heartache
Of every small and large war
Passed from generation
To generation.
But it is not in me to give up.
I was taught to give honor to the house of the warriors
Which cannot exist without the house of the peacemakers.
DIRECTIONS TO YOU
Rainy Dawn Ortiz
Follow them, stop, turn around
Go the other way.
Left, right,
Mine, yours.
We become lost,
Unsteady.
Take a deep breath,
Pray.
You will not always be lost.
You are right here,
In your time,
In your place.
Star, guidance as we look up
To the brightest white
Hoping it leads you to where you want to go,
Hoping that it knows where you should be.
We find our peace here in the white,
Gather our strength, our breath, and learn how to be.
2. East
The sun rises,
Red,
Morning heat on our face even on the coldest morning.
The sun creates life,
Energy,
Nourishment.
Gather strength, pull it in
Be right where you are.
3. South
Butterfly flits
Spreads yellow beauty.
We have come to this moment in time
Step by step,
We don’t always listen to directions,
We let the current carry us,
Push us,
Force us along the path.
We stumble,
Get up and keep moving.
4. West
Sunsets, brings
Darkness,
Brings black.
We find solitude,
Time to take in breath and
Pray.
Even in darkness you
Can be found.
Call out even in a whisper
Or whimper,
You will be heard.
To find,
To be found,
To be understood,
To be seen,
Heard, felt.
You are,
Breath.
You are,
Memory.
You are,
Touch.
You are,
Right here.
SEVEN GENERATIONS
Children play with full bellies
At the edge of the mating dance.
Beneath a sky thrown open
To the need of stars
To know themselves against the dark.
All night we dance the weave of joy and tears
All night we’re lit with the sunrise of forever
Just ahead of us, through the trees
One generation after the other.
In 1990 a congress of indigenous peoples met outside of Quito, Ecuador, to
discuss the Columbian Quincentenary, a celebration by immigrant
populations of the arrival of Christopher Columbus to the western
hemisphere on his financed expedition to find a trade route to India. Tribal
people came from all of the Americas and met to discuss the destructive and
monumental changes since this European explorer’s arrival. We met together
to gain insight and strength and ponder how we would continue to move
forward past the massive destruction and disrespect of the earth mind, body
and spirit, and to continue our sovereignty as Native nations.
In the women’s circle, a striking Bolivian Indian woman in a bowler hat
stood up. She welcomed us, and noted that she was surprised at all of the
Natives attending from the United States.
“We thought John Wayne had killed all of you.”
(This was not a joke.)
“And why,” she asked, “Do you call yourselves America? This hemisphere
is one body, one person. She is America.”
WEAPONS,
OR WHAT I HAVE TAKEN IN MY HAND TO SPEAK
WHEN I HAVE NO WORDS
(inspired by T. C. Cannon’s images)
BLACK—Before there was anything else possible. We settled there, not far
from the river, at the ragged edge of night. There were no words for eyes or
light, or even being. Imagination took its first breath, while we were camped
there in the nowhere.
YELLOW—We struck up a conversation. Somebody opened their hands with
food. The drum brought forth the language of the earth. An elder woman’s
voice urged the stars out of their houses to come dance with us. A young man
followed with a new song that brought excitement to the young women
wrapped in shawls who were dancing, and brought forth ancestors who
danced with us.
RED—Each of us is a wave in the river of humanity. If we break we bleed
out. If we move forward together we are bound together by scarlet waters of
belief. One side is war. One side feeds the generations. We are bright with
the need for life.
GREEN—After winter snow, after you have left, after giving up, after the
planting, after letting the horses free to roam, after the loving, after yes, never
no. The grasses rise up from the earth to answer the winds in song. After I
rise up with this shimmering love to sing.
BLUE—If you really love me sweetheart you would not forsake me here at
the dawn of forever. I will always love you, always, sang the sky to eternity.
I will meet you there, at the seamless edge of sunrise.
THE STORY WHEEL
I leave you to your ceremony of grieving
Which is also of celebration
Given when an honored humble one
Leaves behind a trail of happiness
In the dark of human tribulation.
None of us is above the other
In this story of forever.
Though we follow that red road home,
one behind another.
There is a light breaking through the storm
And it is buffalo hunting weather.
There you can see your mother.
She is busy as she was ever—
She holds up a new jingle dress, for her youngest beloved daughter.
And for her special son, a set of finely beaded gear.
All for that welcome home dance,
The most favorite of all—
when everyone finds their way back together
to dance, eat and celebrate.
And tell story after story
of how they fought and played
in the story wheel
and how no one
was ever really lost at all.
Once I looked at the moon and caught sight of a strange thing. A cricket had
perched upon the handrail, only a few inches away from me. My line of
vision was such that the creature filled the moon like a fossil. It had gone
there, I thought, to live and die, for there, of all places, was its small
definition made whole and eternal. A warm wind rose up and purled like the
longing within me.
—N. SCOTT MOMADAY, The Way to Rainy Mountain, 1969
Until the passage of the Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978, it was illegal
for Native citizens to practice our cultures. This included the making and
sharing of songs and stories. Songs and stories in one culture are poetry and
prose in another. They are intrinsic to cultural sovereignty. To write or create
as a Native person was essentially illegal.
WASHING MY MOTHER’S BODY
I never got to wash my mother’s body when she died.
I return to take care of her in memory.
That’s how I make peace when things are left undone.
I go back and open the door.
I step in to make my ritual. To do what should have been done,
what needs to be fixed so that my spirit can move on,
So that the children and grandchildren are not caught in a knot
Of regret they do not understand.
I find the white enamel pan she used for bread and biscuits.
It is the same pan she used to bathe us when we were babies.
I turn the faucet on and hold my hand under the water
until it is warm, the temperature one uses to wash an infant.
I find a clean washcloth in a stack of washcloths.
She had nothing in her childhood.
She made sure she had plenty of everything
when she grew up and made her own life.
Her closets were full of pretty dresses,
so many she had not time to wear them all.
They were bought by the young girl who wore the same flour sack dress
to school every day, the one she had to wash out every night,
and hang up to dry near the wood stove.
I pick up the bar of soap from her sink,
the same soap she used yesterday morning to wash her face.
When she looked in the mirror, did she know it would be her last sunrise?
I move over pill bottles, a clock radio on the table by the bed,
a pen, and set down the pan. I straighten the blankets over her,
to keep her warm, for dignity.
I start with her face. Her face is unlined even two months before
her eightieth birthday. She was known for her beauty,
and when younger passed for the Cherokee
that she was through her mother and her mother’s mother
all the way back to time’s beginning.
My mother had the iron pot given to her by her Cherokee mother,
whose mother gave it to her, given to her by the U.S. government
on the Trail of Tears.
She grew flowers in it.
As I wash my mother’s face, I tell her
how beautiful she is, how brave, how her beauty and bravery
live on in her grandchildren. Her face is relaxed, peaceful.
Her earth memory body has not left yet,
but when I see her the next day, embalmed and in the casket
in the funeral home, it will be gone.
Where does it go?
It is heavier than the spirit who lifted up and flew.
I think of it making the rounds to every place it has loved to say goodbye.
Goodbye to the house where I brought my babies home, she sings.
Goodbye to June’s Bar where I was the shuffleboard queen.
I cannot say goodbye yet.
I will never say goodbye.
I lift up each arm to wash. Her hands still wear her favorite rings.
She loved her body and decorated it with shiny jewelry,
with creams and makeup.
I am tender over that burn scar on her arm,
From when she cooked at the place with the cruel boss
who insisted she reach her hand into the Fryolator to clean it.
She had protested it was still hot, and suffered a deep burn.
That scar always reminded me of her coming in
from working long hours in restaurants,
her uniform drenched with sweat, determination and exhaustion.
Once she came home and I was burning up with a fever.
She pulled out the same pan I am dipping the washcloth in now,
only she’s added rubbing alcohol, to bring the fever down.
She washes tenderly, tells me about how her friend Chunkie
left her husband again, how she knows her old boss,
a Jewish woman who treated her kindly,
has cancer. She doesn’t know how she knows;
she just knows.
She doesn’t tell me that—
I find it in a journal she has left me,
a day book in which she has written notes
for me to find when she is gone.
I wash her neck and lift the blankets to move down her heart.
I thank her body for carrying us through the tough story.
through the violence of my father, and her second husband.
Her mother’s mother died when she was born
and her adoptive mother, another Cherokee woman,
had no love in her heart for a tiny girl
whose light hair betrayed her Indian-ness,
unlike the baby’s older, darker sister who would stay
within their circle.
Because her mother was not there for her,
My grandmother did not know how to mother my mother.
The story is all there, in her body, as I wash her to prepare her
to be let down into earth, and return all stories to the earth.
My body memories rise up as I wash.
I recall carrying my two children, rocking them,
and feeding them from my body.
How I knew myself as beloved Earth, in that body.
I uncover my mother’s legs.
I remember the varicose veins that swelled like rivers
when my mother would get off a long shift of standing and cooking.
They carried more than a woman should carry.
A woman should be honored like a queen,
traditionally we treated our women with that kind of respect,
my Creek husband tells me.
Ha, I laugh and ask him, “then why aren’t you cooking my dinner?”
I wash her feet, caress them.
You will have some rest now, I tell my mother,
even as I know my mother was never one for resting.
I cover her.
I make the final wring of the washcloth and drape it over the pan.
I brush my mother’s hair and kiss her forehead.
I ask the keepers of the journey to make sure her travel is safe and sure.
I ask the angels, whom she loved and with whom she spoke frequently,
to take her home, but wait, not before I find her favorite perfume.
Then I sing her favorite song, softly.
I don’t know the name of the song, just a few phrases,
one of those old homemade heartbreak songs
where there’s a moment of happiness
wound through—
and then I let her go.
There is a map, a series of maps that are t/here and have always been t/here.
They are transparent and layered, one on top of another. One generation over
another, the lines of connection are relentlessly weaving, patterning
rhythmically, mythically, and historically by image, sound and sense. Each
map is a being with a mouth and a tail, even as it is a field of ocean or grass.
They are making helixes of memory; memory is always moving.
My mother was a songwriter and singer. She is William Blake’s “Little lamb,
who made thee / Dost thou know who made thee?” and Alfred Lord
Tennyson. She is the traditional Cherokee songs sung at her aunt’s funeral.
She is the “Burning Ring of Fire” running away to Independence, Kansas, at
sixteen. She is “Crazy” sung by Patsy Cline in a wake of heartache. That was
my mother, singing, all those years. My mother’s gifts were trampled by
economic necessity and emotional imprisonment.
My father was a dancer, a rhythm keeper. His ancestors were orators,
painters, tribal chiefs, stomp dancers, preachers, and speakers. His mother
was a saxophone player and painter in Indian Territory before Oklahoma
statehood. All his relatively short life he looked for a vision or song to
counter the heartache of history.
Rivers are the old roads, as are songs, to traverse memory.
I emerged from the story, dripping with the waters of memory.
RISING AND FALLING
Human poetry is a restless soul
And does not always know what it holds,
When it is regaling beloved guests at a table
Graced with food and drink. What
Songs of tempestuous rising and falling,
One country after another.
THE ROAD TO DISAPPEARANCE
“The Indians will vanish” has been the talk of the older Indians ever since
the white people first came to mingle among them. They seemed to prophesy
that the coming of the white man would not be for their good and when the
step toward their removal to a country to the west was just beginning, it was
the older Indians who remarked and talked about themselves by saying,
“Now, the Indian is now on the road to disappearance.” This had reference to
their leaving of their ways, their familiar surroundings where their customs
were performed, their medicine, their hunting grounds and their friends.
When they had reached their new homes in the Indian Territory, their
conversations were about their old homes and they said, “We have started on
the road that leads to our disappearance and we are facing the evening of our
existence and are nearly at the end of the trail that we trod when we were
forced to leave our homes in Alabama and Georgia. In time, perhaps our own
language will not be used but that will be after our days.”

MAMA AND PAPA HAVE THE GOING HOME
SHIPROCK BLUES
(based on T. C. Cannon painting titles)
Song 1.
Beef Issue at Fort Sill
We were corralled then
Like horses, like captives
Like slaves. We were
Anything but horses, captives,
And slaves. But we were
hungry.
Song 2.
Two Guns Arikara
The right hand knows what the left
Hand is dreaming.
The left hand might be less sure of
The absolute world but it knows
How to follow.
Together.
We have it.
Song 3.
Soldiers
We were ready to defend the land
And the people against those
Who wanted what was not theirs to take.
We were called heathen
But who is heathen here?
Song 4.
Sioux-Soldier-Sold
There is the law of the Creator which
Tells us:
Do not take what is not yours to take.
Do not take more than you can use.
Respect life and the giver of life.
Give back.
Defend your people when there is need
For defense.
And when a people strips your spirit of
Your body and sells your “red skins” for
Bounty, then they are the ones
Who have broken the law.
Song 5.
Zero Hero
The way it is told, is we are one people
Then there was a disagreement.
Some went east. Some west.
We were bound to meet up.
We could have had a feast and helped each other.
Made an alliance.
We could have run horses together, gone hunting
For food, cooked, and stayed up sharing stories
About where we came from and where we are going:
Together.
Song 6.
Let ’Em Eat Grass
What we speak always returns
With a spike of barbs
Or the sweet taste of berries in summer.
Song 7.
Three Ghost Figures
The Past rose up before us and cried
In the voices of the children who were dragged
To Indian school and never returned.
The Present spoke up and those who remembered
How to listen could hear.
We offered tobacco and paid attention
To their stories.
The Future was a path through soldiers
With Gatling guns and GMO spoiled crops
Motioning us to safety.
Song 8.
All the Tired Horses in the Sun and Waiting Indians in Hospital
Forever.
And ever.
And ever.
There’s my cousin. Auntie. Uncle.
Another cousin.
Ever.
And ever.
And ever.
Vending machines and pop.
Chips, candy and not enough clean water.
And ever, ever, ever.
Waiting and tired.
Tired of waiting.
Forever.
And ever.
And ever.
Go water the horses.
Song 9.
It’s a Good Day to Die
What a good dance
All night under the stars
Under the blanket with you
Honey.
We go home in our old chidi.
Must run on love
Because we can’t afford gas.
Sun coming up
We give thanks to the Creator
For life, these lands
Family, how the bad is always
Followed by something good
I love you forever, honey.
A love like ours never
Dies.
My great-grandfather Monahwee (Menawa) Okfuskee, one of the Red Stick
chiefs, emigrated west along with his wife Betsy Coser and their extended
family, with Detachment 3, which started four miles east of Talladega. This
was the detachment of Upper Creeks living along the Tallapoosa from
Horseshoe Bend to Tallassee. There were two prominent chiefs in this party.
The other was Tuscoona Harjo of Fish Pond. This party was conducted to
Indian Territory by Dr. R. W. Williams on behalf of the Alabama Emigrating
Company. They left about noon on September 17, 1836.
A few weeks before the party set out, the first English newspaper was
established in Hawaii.
The most popular songs in the country as they set foot were “The Carrier
Dove,” “Corn Cobs Twist Your Hair,” “The Light of Other Days (The Maid
of Artois)” and “Rory O’More.”
By November they would camp twelve miles below Memphis. Memphis was
erected over Choctaw and Chickasaw territories. The city of Memphis was
founded in 1819.
HOW TO WRITE A POEM IN A TIME OF WAR
You can’t begin just anywhere. It’s a wreck.
Shrapnel and the eye
Of a house, a row of houses. There’s a rat scrambling
From light with fleshy trash in its mouth. A baby strapped
to its mother’s back, cut loose.
Soldiers crawl the city,
the river, the town, the village,
the bedroom, our kitchen. They eat everything.
Or burn it.
They kill what they cannot take. They rape. What they cannot kill
they take.
Rumors fall like rain.
Like bombs.
Like mother and father tears
swallowed for restless peace.
Like sunset slanting toward a moonless midnight.
Like a train blown free of its destination.
Like a seed
fallen where
there is no chance of trees
or anyplace
for birds
to live.
No, start here.
Deer peer from the edge of the woods.
We used to see woodpeckers
the size of the sun, and were greeted
by chickadees with their good morning songs.
We’d started to cook outside, slippery with dew and laughter,
ah these smoky sweet sunrises.
We tried to pretend war wasn’t going to happen.
Though they began building their houses all around us
and demanding more.
They started teaching our children their god’s story,
A story in which we’d always be slaves.
No. Not here.
You can’t begin here.
This is memory shredded because it is impossible to hold with words,
even poetry.
. . .
These memories were left here with the trees:
The torn pocket of your daughter’s hand-sewn dress,
the sash, the lace.
The baby’s delicately beaded moccasin still connected to the foot,
A young man’s note of promise to his beloved—
No! This is not the best place to begin.
Everyone was asleep, despite the distant bombs.
Terror had become the familiar stranger.
Our beloved twin girls curled up in their nightgowns,
next to their father and me.
If we begin here, none of us will make it to the end
Of the poem.
Someone has to make it out alive, sang a grandfather
to his grandson, his granddaughter,
as he blew his most powerful song into the hearts of the children.
There it would be hidden from the soldiers,
Who would take them miles, rivers, mountains
from the navel cord place of the origin story.
He knew one day, far day, the grandchildren would return,
generations later over slick highways, constructed over old trails
Through walls of laws meant to hamper or destroy, over stones
bearing libraries of the winds.
He sang us back
to our home place from which we were stolen
in these smoky green hills.
Yes, begin here.
MVSKOKE MOURNING SONG
Sin-e-cha was aboard the Monmouth, which sank in the Mississippi River.
In 1937, Elsie Edwards related the following story of Sin-e-cha:
“Somewhere upon the banks of the Grand River near Fort Gibson lies an old
grave of an old lady whose name was Sin-e-cha. I could lead you to that
grave today. Sin-e-cha had come with her tribal town of Ke-cho-ba-da-gee
during the removal to the new country. When the events, with never no more
to live in the east, had taken place, she, too, remembered that she had left her
home and with shattered happiness she carried a small bundle of her few
belongings and reopening and retying her pitiful bundle she began a sad song
which was later taken up by the others on board the ship at the time of the
wreck and the words of her song were:
“ ‘I have no more land. I am driven away from home, driven up the red
waters, let us all go, let us all die together and somewhere upon the banks we
will be there.’ ”

FIRST MORNING
for Shan Goshorn, December 3, 2018
This is the first morning we are without you on earth.
The sun greeted us after a week of rain
In your eastern green and mountain homelands.
Plants are fed, the river restored, and you have been woven
Into a path of embracing stars of all colors
Now free of the suffering that shapes us here.
We all learn to let go, like learning how to walk
When we first arrive here.
All those you thought you lost now circle you
And you are free of pain and heartbreak.
Don’t look back, keep going.
We will carry your memory here, until we join you
In just a little while, in one blink of star time.
SINGING EVERYTHING
Once there were songs for everything,
Songs for planting, for growing, for harvesting,
For eating, getting drunk, falling asleep,
For sunrise, birth, mind-break, and war.
For death (those are the heaviest songs and they
Have to be pried from the earth with shovels of grief).
Now all we hear are falling-in-love songs and
Falling apart after falling in love songs.
The earth is leaning sideways
And a song is emerging from the floods
And fires. Urgent tendrils lift toward the sun.
You must be friends with silence to hear.
The songs of the guardians of silence are the most powerful—
They are the most rare.
FALLING FROM THE NIGHT SKY
(a song)
I was a star falling from the night sky
I needed you to catch me
I was a rainbow lifting from a dark cloud
I needed you to see me
You keep your eyes to the ground
Walk that line she had to you.
That path of patient expectation.
Keeps you true to her undoing.
My heart wore flowers and a red dress.
The first time we kissed
You smelled of happiness and moonlight
We drove the night to tenderness.
When you’re here we are the sun and the moon.
In the land where promises come true.
When you’re here, we share imagination
No explanations.
It’s just me, and you.
You keep your eyes to the ground
Walk that line she had to you.
That path of patient expectation.
Keeps you true to her undoing.
I am a star falling from the night sky
I need you to catch me
I am a rainbow lifting from a dark cloud
I need you to see me
Our knowledge is based on the origin stories of land, genealogy and
ancestors. If you know the branches of the tree of relationship between tribal
clans and family members, then you know who you are, said the panther to its
cubs.
FOR EARTH’S GRANDSONS
Stand tall, no matter your height, how dark your skin
Your spirit is all colors within
You are made of the finest woven light
From the iridescent love that formed your mothers, fathers
Your grandparents all the way back on the spiral road—
There is no end to this love
It has formed your bodies
Feeds your bright spirits
And no matter what happens in these times of breaking—
No matter dictators, the heartless, and liars
No matter—you are born of those
Who kept ceremonial embers burning in their hands
All through the miles of relentless exile
Those who sang the path through massacre
All the way to sunrise
You will make it through—
RUNNING
It’s closing time. Violence is my boyfriend
With a cross to bear
Hoisted on by the church.
He wears it everywhere.
There are no female deities in the Trinity.
I don’t know how I’m going to get out of here,
Said the flying fish to the tree.
Last call.
We’ve had it with history, we who look for vision here
In the Indian and poetry bar, somewhere
To the left of Hell.
Now I have to find my way, when there’s a river to cross and no
Boat to get me there, when there appears to be no home at all.
My father gone, chased
By the stepfather’s gun. Get out of here.
I’ve found my father at the bar, his ghost at least, some piece
Of him in this sorry place. The boyfriend’s convincing to a crowd.
Right now, he’s the spell of attraction. What tales he tells.
In the fog of thin hope, I wander this sad world
We’ve made with the enemy’s words.
The lights quiver,
Like they do when the power’s dwindling to a dangling string.
It is time to go home. We are herded like stoned cattle, like children for the
bombing drill—
Out the door, into the dark street of this old Indian town
Where there are no Indians anymore.
I was afraid of the dark because then I could see
Everything. The truth with its eyes staring
Back at me. The mouth of the dark with its shiny moon teeth,
No words, just a hiss and a snap.
I could hear my heart hurting
With my in-the-dark ears.
I thought I could take it. Where was the party?
It’s been a century since we left home with the American soldiers at our
backs.
The party had long started up in the parking lot.
He flew through the dark, broke my stride with a punch.
I went down then came up.
I thought I could take being a girl with her heart in her
Arms. I carried it for justice. For the rights of all Indians.
We all had that cross to bear.
Those Old Ones followed me, the quiet girl with the long dark hair,
The daughter of a warrior who wouldn’t give up.
I wasn’t ready yet, to fling free the cross
I ran and I ran through the 2 A.M. streets.
It was my way of breaking free. I was anything but history.
I was the wind.
A REFUGE IN THE SMALLEST OF PLACES
For Emily Dickinson, one of the singers.
And for all who those fleeing on those ancient migration
trails north, for home.
Someone sang for me and no one else could hear it
When I had given up and made knife marks on my arm
Or drank and gave myself away or was given
Someone sang for me and no one else could hear it
When demons came with rope and cages
To take my children from me and imprison us
Someone sang for me and no one else could hear it
Now I am here in the timeless room of lost poetry
Gathering up the destroyed and forgotten
Because of the songs someone sang that no one else could hear
But me.
I’M NOBODY! WHO ARE YOU?
Emily Dickinson
I’m Nobody! Who are you?
Are you – Nobody – too?
Then there’s a pair of us!
Don’t tell! they’d advertise – you know!
How dreary – to be – Somebody!
How public – like a Frog –
To tell one’s name – the livelong June –
To an admiring Bog!
Emily Dickinson was six years old when Monahwee and his family began the
emigration to the West.
BOURBON AND BLUES
for T. C. Cannon, a brother of poetry and song
We were wild then,
As we emerged from bloody history
Into the white clothes of pious religion and rules.
Then sent off to Indian school to learn how to forget
Our mothers, fathers, the grandparents who loved and love us.
We were still in the embrace of the God of the plains,
Horses, of where sky and earth meet—
Every day was a praise song, every word or act had import
Into the meaning of why we are here as spirits
Dressed in colored earth.
We were wild then,
They said, because we spoke a different language
And would not give over our spirits to them.
And though they tried, they could not ever remake us
No matter how hard they drilled and forced us.
We died over and over again in those stiff desks,
As our hearts walked home.
We sat on the fire escapes outside our dorm rooms on cold winter nights
And made plans to escape history.
We were wild then.
We didn’t take well to mind imprisonment.
Our dreams could not be confined by the walls of institutional green
of misbegotten bureaucracy.
We found alcohol, smoke and anything else to break on through to the other
side
Where our visions shivered there near the hills outside of campus,
waiting for us to recover from the sickness of forgetfulness.
Some of us did not make it.
We carried their bodies far away
From the cities and set their spirits free.
This moment is for them—gives them nourishment
Of our love to keep moving toward home.
We were wild then.
I will always remember that night far south
Of town where we sat at the bar after our escape.
You had gone to war and had become a painter, poet and singer.
I was a poet, mother and I was learning how to sing.
We talked history, heartache, the blues, and what it means
To be an artist with nothing to lose, because we lost everything,
here, at the edge of America.
MY GREAT-AUNT ELLA MONAHWEE
JACOBS’S TESTIMONY
“About this time (in the early 1880s), a white man was murdered near
Okfuskee Town and Grandfather Monahwee had been accused. McIntosh was
afraid to attack him, for Grandfather Monahwee was second Chief of the
Creeks and had a reputation for valor and military skill and was always
known to be the leader when danger threatened. Grandfather was also a
doctor of medicine and at all times he would have gourds tied around his
waist filled with different kinds of herbs for his medicines.”
ROAD
We stand first in our minds, and then we toddle
From hand to furniture
Soon we are walking away from the house and lands
Of our ancestral creator gods
To the circles of friends, of schooling, of work
Making families and worlds of our own.
We make our way through storm and sun
We walk side by side or against each other
The last road will be taken alone—
There might be crowds calling for blood
Or a curtained window by the leaving bed
It is best to not be afraid
Lift your attention
For the appearance of the next road
It might be through a family of trees, a desert, or
On rolling waves of sea
It’s the ancient road the soul knows
We always remember it when we see it
It beckons at birth
It carries us home
The Southeast was covered with Mississippian mound builder cities and
communities a century before Spanish arrival in the Southeast. The Southeast
is still covered with the remains of mounds. There are even mounds on the
University of Tennessee, Knoxville campus. These mounds might be leveled
by shovels, tractors or hate, but they will show up on any energetic
geophysical map. They continue to exist in memory, in memory maps.
It is said that Monahwee got his warrior name Hopothepoya (Crazy War
Hunter) from stealing horses in Knoxville. Knoxville was in traditional
Mvskoke territory, therefore, the horses were not technically stolen. They
were on stolen lands.
When I returned to these homelands I came by old trails. One of the most
traveled trails is part of Interstate 40.
DESIRE’S DOG
I was desire’s dog.
I ate when I was fed. I did what I was told.
I knew how to sit, stand and roll over on command.
When I was petted, I was made whole.
Even when I dreamed, I dreamed a chain around my neck.
Desire is a bone with traces of fat.
It’s the wag smell of a bitch in heat.
It’s that pinched hit at the end of a beat.
It’s a stick thrown into a rabbit chase.
I lay at the feet of desire for years.
Then I heard this song, calling me.
It was a woman in a red dress,
It was a man with a gun in his hand.
It was a table filled with fruit and flowers.
It was a fox of fire, a bird of stone.
Then, it was gone.
What was left disintegrated by rain and wind.
I had followed desire, to the end.
DAWNING
Even the birds were still sleeping
When I touched ground.
I went around the house, opening
Windows, then the plants.
Made my tea, wrote until breaking
Of morning. I went back
Up the stairs to see if you were waking.
Ever so quiet the smoky light
Covered the hills, no one making
The rounds yet to pick up trash
Or edge the grass. You were dreaming
When I cradled your head.
Your mother’s loving
Tenderly in place though she’s been gone
For many years, and you graying
Though ever handsome
In my arms. I tiptoe back to the breaking
Of light and let you sleep—
My king, my everything.
HONORING
Who sings to the plants
That are grown for our plates?
Are they gathered lovingly
In aprons or arms?
Or do they suffer the fate
Of the motor-driven whip
Of the monster reaper?
No song at all, only
The sound of money
Being stacked in a bank
Who stitched the seams in my clothes
One line after another?
Was the room sweaty and dark
With no hour to spare?
Did she have enough to eat?
Did she have a home anywhere?
Or did she live on the floor?
And where were the children?
Or was the seamstress the child
With no home of his or her own?
Who sacrifices to make clothes
For strangers of another country?
And why?
Let’s remember to thank the grower of food
The picker, the driver,
The sun and the rain.
Let’s remember to thank each maker of stitch
And layer of pattern,
The dyer of color
In the immense house of beauty and pain.
Let’s honor the maker.
Let’s honor what’s made.
MY MAN’S FEET
They are heroic roots
You cannot mistake them
For any other six-foot walker
I could find them in a sea of feet
A planet or universe of feet
They kicked the sky at birth
In that town his great-grandfather found
My man’s feet left childhood
Past the mineral grit of an oil flush bust
To these atomic eastbound lands
His feet are made of his mother’s spiritual concern
And of his father: historic, and mindfully upright
What walkers—
From mound builder steps that led to the sky maker
Past Spanish galleons, stage coach, and railroad snaker
One generation following another
No other feet but these could bare
The rock stubborn loyal bear
Towering intelligence and children picker upper
That is the one who owns these feet
What an anchor his feet provide
For his unmatched
Immensability and get up againality
I’ve danced behind this man in the stomp dance circle.
Our feet beating rhythm together
Man, woman, boy, girl, sun and moon jumper.
My man’s feet are the sure steps of a father
Looking after his sons, his daughters
For when he laughs he opens all the doors of our hearts
Even as he forgets to shut them when he leaves
And when he grieves for those he loves
He carves out valleys enough to hold everyone’s tears
With his feet, these feet
My man’s widely humble, ever steady, beautiful brown feet.
“I WONDER WHAT YOU ARE THINKING,”
The feathered wife asked her feathered husband—
She watches as he cleans his wings, notes how he sends his eyes over the
horizon
To viridian in the flying away direction.
So many migrations stacked within sky memory.
Her body is stirring with eggs. She tucks found materials
Into their nest with her beak.
The nerves in her wingtips sense rains coming to soften the ground.
To send food to the surface of earth.
He says nothing—
As he wonders about the careless debris that humans make
Even as it yields ribbon, floss and string.
Housecats and their sporting trails are on his mind’s map.
There are too many in this neighborhood.
A ragged yellow fellow eats birds after hours of play.
He stays out of that tom’s way, and has warned his wife
The same. Though she’s more wisely wary than him.
Dogs are easy. They bark and leap and wag their tails.
They have no concerns for most flying things.
They lap up human trails for love.
And why do we keep renewing this ceremony of nests?
Each feathered generation flies away.
What does it mean, and why
the green growing green
turning red against yellow,
then gray, gray and green again?
When I need her heartbeat
In the freeze winds why is she always there
And not somewhere else?
Her lilt question has made an echo in his ears
like a string fluttering from a bush
In a delicate spring wind:
I wonder what you are thinking
He doesn’t answer.
Then he does.
“Nothing.
I was thinking about the nothing of nothing at all.”
FOR THOSE WHO WOULD GOVERN
First question: Can you first govern yourself?
Second question: What is the state of your own household?
Third question: Do you have a proven record of community service and
compassionate acts?
Fourth question: Do you know the history and laws of your principalities?
Fifth question: Do you follow sound principles? Look for fresh vision to lift
all the inhabitants of the land, including animals, plants, elements, all who
share this earth?
Sixth question: Are you owned by lawyers, bankers, insurance agents,
lobbyists, or other politicians, anyone else who would unfairly profit by your
decisions?
Seventh question: Do you have authority by the original keepers of the lands,
those who obey natural law and are in the service of the lands on which you
stand?
RABBIT INVENTS THE SAXOPHONE
When one of the last trails of tears wound through New Orleans
Rabbit, that ragged trickster, decided he wanted
To be a musician. He was tired of walking. And they had all the fun.
They got all the women, they were surrounded
By fans who gave them smokes, drinks, and he could have
All kinds of friends to do his bidding.
But, Rabbit hadn’t proved to be musical.
When he led at stomp dance no one would follow.
No shell shaker would shake shells for him.
He was never invited to lead, even when the young ones
Were called up to practice.
The first thing a musician needs is a band, he said to his friends.
The hottest new music was being made at Congo Square—
So many tribes were jamming there: African, Native, and a few remnant
French.
Making a new music of melody, love and beat.
Rabbit climbed up to the stage but had nothing to offer.
Just his strut, charming banter, and what looked like a long stick
Down the tight leg of pants.
Musicians are musicians, no trick will get by.
You either have it, or want it
Nothing else will fly.
Do you know any songs?
What can you play?
Can you sing?
Do you have a piano, tuba, or strings?
The musicians began vamping,
What can this Rabbit cat do?
Is he going to blow hot air
Or fart in the rain?
Rabbit turned his back to the band
Like that genius Miles Davis
Pulled out his stick
He made a horn with his hands.
This stick is so special, bragged Rabbit.
As he turned back to the jam
No one else has one like this.
You’ve never heard it before.
It’s called a sax-oh-oh-phone.
Rabbit’s newborn horn made a rip in the sky
It made old women dance, and girls fall to their knees
It made singers of tricksters, it made tricksters of players
It made trouble wherever it sang after that—
The last time we heard Rabbit was for my cousin’s run for chief.
There was a huge feed. Everyone showed up to eat.
Rabbit’s band got down after the speeches.
We danced through the night, and nobody fought.
Nor did anyone show up the next day to vote.
They were sleeping.
When Adolfe Sax patented the first saxophone on June 23, 1846, the Creek
Nation was in turmoil. The people had been moved west of the Mississippi
River after the Creek Wars which culminated in the Battle of Horseshoe
Bend. We were putting our lives back together in new lands where we were
promised we would be left alone. The saxophone made it across the big
waters and was introduced in brass bands in the South. The music followed
rivers into new towns, cities, all the way to our new lands. Not long after, in
the early 1900s, my grandmother Naomi Harjo learned to play saxophone. I
can feel her now when I play the instrument we both loved and love. The
saxophone is so human. Its tendency is to be rowdy, edgy, talk too loud, bump
into people, say the wrong words at the wrong time, but then, you take a
breath all the way from the center of the earth and blow. All that heartache is
forgiven. All that love we humans carry makes a sweet, deep sound and we
fly a little.
LET THERE BE NO REGRETS
for Bears Ears National Monument
We’re not losing the birch trees, the birch trees are losing us.
—WAYNE “MINOGIIZHIG” VALLIERE
The songs and stories that formed us are restless
and need a place to live in the world of our grandchildren.
They are weary with waiting.
Earth continues to dream her earth dreams
Though desperate thoughts fed by money hunger roam our minds.
To the destroyers, Earth is not a person.
They will want more until there is no more to steal.
Earth who does not know time is patient.
The destroyers will destroy themselves.
So many earth spirits take care of this place. They emerge from the cliff
walls.
They emerge from the waves of waters.
Our ancestors are not only human ancestors.
What do you see when you fly to the top of the ancestor tree?
Let there be no regrets, no sadness, no anger, no acts of disturbance to these
lands.
ADVICE FOR COUNTRIES, ADVANCED,
DEVELOPING AND FALLING
A CALL AND RESPONSE
A country is a person.
A country is a noun, to be bought and sold. I have a deed.
The ruler’s disposition and rules determine the state of being for all
constituents.
Each state governs itself without respect for individuals. It’s everyone for
themselves.
Power is dangerous when wielded in the hands of one. It is meant to be
shared.
I was given this position by cunning, by money, by sex, by family, by God.
It belongs to me and no one else.
We cannot own anyone else, people, the lands, or resources. We are here to
care for each other.
We are right. We build walls to keep anyone who is not like us out of here.
God gave us these lands. We separate children and cage them because
they are breaking our God’s law.
Every increment of any thought, action, or deed matters, has consequences in
all directions.
Not if you can make a law. Not if it passes the Supreme Court. Not if we
can pay for it.
There will be no balance without all voices present in the power circle.
You will never earn your way here. You are the wrong sex, wrong color of
skin, wrong sexual orientation, not my religion, not my language.
We are making our grandchildren’s world with our words. We perceive a
world in which everyone sits at the table together, with enough for
everyone.
“We will make this country great again.”
TOBACCO ORIGIN STORY
It was way back, before there was a way back
When time threaded earth and sky
Children were conceived, were born, grew, and walked tall
In what we now call a day.
Every planted thought grew plant
Ladders to the stars, way back, before there was
No way back, Miss Mary Mack
We used to sing along the buttons of her
Dress. Our babies are always
Our babies. Even back then when time waved through
The corn. We knew our plants like
Relatives. Their stories were our stories, there
Were songs for everything then,
for every transformation
From that first couple, a young Mvskoke man
And woman, who walked through the
shimmer of the early evening.
They had become as one song.
They lay down when it was dark. I can hear their
Intimate low-voice talking
How they tease each other with such gut love.
Earth makes a bed, with pillow
Mounds. And it is there as the night insects sing
They conceived their first child. They
Will look back as they walk east toward the sunrise
The raw stalks of beginning
Will drink the light, root deeply dark into earth.
In the tracks of their loving
The plant child emerges, first the seed head, then
Leafy, long male body and the white female
Flowers of tobacco, or
Hece, as the people called it when it called
To them. Come here. We were brought
To you from those who love you. We will help you.
And that’s how it began, way
Back, when we knew how to hear the songs of plants
And could sing back, like now
On paper, with marks like bird feet, but where are
Our ears? They have grown to fit
Around earbuds, to hear music made for cold
Cash, like our beloved smoke
Making threaded with addiction and dead words.
Sing this song back to me girl.
In the moonlight tobacco plant had silver
Moon buttons all up her back.
We’re getting dressed to go plant new songs with words.
Our sun is dimming faster.
Mvto hece, mvto hvse, mvto—
Ekvnvchaga, mvto ah
My aunt Lois Harjo told me that our grandfather Monahwee had to go into
hiding once, after removal to Indian Territory. When he came upon a white
man beating his wife in the street, he took the whip from the husband’s hand
and beat him. The government agents of law enforcement in Okmulgee looked
for Monahwee to charge him with a crime, but he hid out in the pockets of
Native communities that white men didn’t enter.
Monahwee is buried near Eufaula, Oklahoma, in a small Creek Indian family
cemetery. His unmarked gravesite is surrounded by seven cedar trees. My
cousin John Scott, known as “Porky,” showed me his burial place.
REDBIRD LOVE
We watched her grow up.
She was the urgent chirper,
Fledgling flier.
And when spring rolled
Out its green
She’d grown
Into the most noticeable
Bird-girl.
Long-legged and just
The right amount of blush
Tipping her wings, crest
And tail, and
She knew it
In the bird parade.
We watched her strut.
She owned her stuff.
The males perked their armor, greased their wings,
And flew sky-loop missions
To show off
For her.
In the end
There was only one.
There’s that one you circle back to—for home.
This morning
The young couple scavenge seeds
On the patio.
She is thickening with eggs.
Their minds are busy with sticks the perfect size, tufts of fluff
Like dandelion, and other pieces of soft.
He steps aside for her, so she can eat.
Then we watch him fill his beak
Walk tenderly to her and kiss her with seed.
The sacred world lifts up its head
To notice—
We are double, triple blessed.
We follow the DNA spiral of stories from dawn to dusk, from night dance to
sunrise. Once I was brought into the memory of the Battle of Horseshoe Bend
by time. Time rides the spiral with wild precision. When I got there with
time in time, the earthworks planted for defense of heavy logs had been
broken through by Andrew Jackson’s troops. In the hellish fire and smoke of
battle, we could not keep hold of the front line. We were no match for their
numbers, their guns, their cannons. Time in these lands as we knew it was
over and we fought the intruders and the terrible weight of knowing with
everything in us. My grandfather Monahwee was shot seven times, and when
Jackson’s troops pronounced victory and retreated, he crawled to the edge of
the Tallapoosa River and rolled into the bloody current as soldiers
bayoneted the dead and stole booty. My grandfather’s life force curled into
his belly. I felt the giving away to history which in no means meant giving up.
For a warrior it is not possible to give up. I smelled suffering and tasted the
metallic wash of blood, of loss in my mouth. Many of us lay dead and
wounded. Through the immense and terrible echo of injustice a meadow bird
sang and sang.
BECOMING SEVENTY
for Marilyn Kallet
We
arrived
when the days
grew legs of night—
Chocolates were offered
We ate latkes for hours
To celebrate light and friends—
We will keep going despite dark
Or a madman in a white house dream.
Let’s talk about something else said the dog
Who begs faithfully at the door of good will:
A biscuit will do, a voice of reason, meat sticks—
I dreamed all of this I told her, you, me, and Paris—
It was impossible to make it through the tragedy
Without poetry. What are we without winds becoming words?
Becoming old children born to children born to sing us into
Love. Another level of love, beyond the neighbor’s holiday light
Display proclaiming goodwill to all men who have lost their way in the dark
As they tried to find the car door, the bottle hidden behind the seat, reason
To keep on going past all the times they failed at sharing love, love. It’s weak
they think—
Or some romantic bullshit, a movie set propped up behind on slats, said the
wizard
Of junk understanding who pretends to be the wise all-knowing dog behind a
cheap fan—
It’s in the plan for the new world straining to break through the floor of this
one, said the Angel of—
All-That-You-Know-And-Forgot-And-Will-Find, as she flutters at the edge
of your mind when you try hard—
Sing the blues to the future of everything that might happen and will. All the
losses come tumbling—
Down, down, down at three in the morning as do all the shouldn’t haves or
should haves. It doesn’t matter, girl, girl—
I’ll be here to pick you up, said Memory, in her red shoes, and the dress that
showed off brown legs. When you first met
Him at the age you have always loved, hair perfect with a little wave, and
that shine in your skin from believing that—
Impossible was possible, you were not afraid. You stood up in love in a
French story and there fell ever, eve—
A light rain as you crossed the Seine to meet him for café in St. Germaine de
Pres. You wrote a poem beneath the tender moon—
Skin from your ribs to your hip bone, in the slender then, and you are still
writing that song to convince the sweetness of every
Bit of straggling moonlight, star and sunlight to become words in your mouth,
in your kiss—that kiss that will never die, you will always fall—
fall way in love. It doesn’t matter how old, how many days, hours, or
memories, we can fall in love over and over and then—
again. The Seine or Tennessee or any river with a soul knows the depths
descending when it comes to seeing the sun or moon stare stars—
Back, without shame, remorse, or guilt. This is what I remember she told her
husband when they bedded down that night in the house that would begin
their
Marriage. That house was built of twenty-four doves, rugs from India,
cooking recipes from seven generations of mother, hope, and their sisters,
And wave upon wave of tears, and the concrete of resolution for the steps
that continue all the way to the heavens, past guardian lion dogs, dog
After dog to protect. They are humble earth angels, and the rowdiest, even
nasty. You try and lick yourself like that, imagine. And the shrewd Old
Woman laughed as she slipped off her cheap shoes and parked them under the
bed that lay at the center of the garden of good and evil. She’d seen it all.
Done it much
More than once. Tonight, she just wanted a good sleep, and picked up the
book of poetry by her bed, which was over a journal she kept when her
mother was dying.
These words from May Sarton she kept in the fourth room of her heart,
“Love, come upon him warily and deep / For if he startle first it were as well
/ to bind a fox’s throat
With a gold bell / As hold him when it is his will to leap. . . .” And she
considered that every line of a poem was a lead line into the spirit world to
capture a bit of
Memory, pieces of gold confetti, a kind of celebration. We all want to be
remembered, even memory, even the way the light came on bright in the
kitchen
Window, when her mother turned up the dial on that cool mist color of a
radio, when memory crossed the path of longing and took mother’s arm and
she put down her apron
Said, “I don’t mind if I do,” and they danced, you watching, as you began
your own cache of remembering. Already you had stored the taste of mother
as sweet milk, father as a labor
Of sweat and love, and night as a lonely boat of stars that took you into who
you were before you slid through the hips of the story. There are no words
when you cross the rippling skin of the
Gate of forbidden waters, or is it a sheer scarf of the finest silk, or is it
something else that causes you to forget. Nothing is ever forgotten says the
god of remembering
who protects the heartbeat of every little cell of knowing from the Antarctic
to the soft spot at the top of this planetary baby. Oh baby, come here, hear, let
me tell you the story
of the party you will never forget, no matter where you go, where you are, or
where you will be when you cross the line and say, no more. No more greedy
kings, no more disappointments, no more orphans, no—
or thefts of souls or lands, no more killing for the sport of killing. No more,
no more, except more of the story so I will understand exactly what I am
doing here, and why, she said to the red fox
guardian who took her arm to help her cross the road that was given to the
care of Natives who made sure the earth spirits were fed with songs, and the
other things they loved to eat. They like sweets, cookies, salt and flowers.
It was getting late and the fox guardian picked up her books as she hurried
through the streets of strife. But it wasn’t getting late. There was no late, only
a plate of tamales on the counter waiting to be, or
. . .
Not to be. At this age, said the fox, we are closer to the not to be, which is
the to be in the fields of sweet grasses. Wherever you are, enjoy the evening,
how the sun walks the horizon before crossing grief—
Over to be, and we then exist under the realm of the water moon. There’s
where fears slay us, in the dark of the howling mind. We all battle. Befriend
them, the moon said as a crab skittered under her skirt, her daughter in
the high chair, waiting for cereal and toast. What a girl she turned out to be, a
willow tree, a blessing to the winds, to her family. There she is married, and
we start the story all over again, said her proud father
in a toast to the happiness of who we are and who we are becoming as slick
change in a new model sedan whips it down the freeway toward the
generations that follow, one after another in the original
lands of the Cherokees who are still here. Nobody goes anywhere though we
are always leaving and returning. It’s a ceremony. Sunrise occurs
everywhere, in lizard time, human time, or a fern uncurling time. When dark
—
we instinctually reach for light food, we digest it, make love, art or trouble.
The sun crowns us at noon. The whole earth is a queen. At sunset say
goodbye to hurt, to suffering, goodbye to the pain you caused others. Good
bye, bye, don’t cry.
Goodbye, goodbye, to Carrie Fisher, the Star Wars phenomenon, and George
Michael the singer. They were planets in our generational emotional
universe. Some of my memories pin to a minute of love on a big screen in an
. . .
imagined future, or broken open when the sax solo of “Careless Whisper”
blows through the communal heart. Yes, there’s a cosmic consciousness. Jung
named it but it was there long before named by Vedic and Mvskoke
scientists. And, there breathes stars here—
a cosmic hearteousness—the heart is the higher mind and nothing can be
forgotten there, no ever or ever. How do I sing this so I don’t forget? Ask the
poets. Each word is a box that can be opened or closed. Then trains of
words, or phrases
garnered by music and the need for rhythm to organize chaos. Like right, now,
in this poem is the transition phase. I remember it while giving birth, summer
sun bearing down on the city melting asphalt but there we were, my daughter
and I,
at the door between worlds. I was happier than ever before to welcome her,
happiness was the path she chose to enter, and I couldn’t push yet, not yet,
and then there appeared a pool of the bluest water. We waited there for a
breath: one, two, three, four
to catch up, and then it did, and she took it that girl who was beautiful beyond
dolphin dreaming, and we made it, we did, to the other side of suffering. This
is the story our mothers tell but we couldn’t hear it in our ears stuffed with
junk advertising,
with our mothers’ own loathing set in place by patriarchal scripture, the
smothering rules to stop insurrection by domesticated slaves . . . wives. It
hurt everybody’s song. The fathers cannot know what they are feeling in such
a spiritual backwash. Worship
boxes set into place by the need for money and power will not beget
freedom. Only war ships. For freedom, freedom, oh freedom sang the slaves,
the oar rhythm of the blues lifting up the spirits of our peoples whose bodies
were worn out, or destroyed by a man’s slash
hit of greed. This is our memory too, said America. Heredity is a field of
blood, celebration, and forgetfulness. Don’t take on more than you can carry,
said the eagle to his twin sons, fighting each other in the sky over a fox,
dangling between them.
It’s that time of the year, when we eat tamales and latkes. We light candles,
make fires to make the way for a newborn child, for fresh understanding.
Demons will try to make houses out of jealousy, anger, pride, greed, or more
destructive material. They place them in a cracked part
of the body that will hold them: liver, heart, knee, or brain. So, my friend,
let’s let that go, for joy, for chocolates made of ashes, mangos, grapefruit, or
chili from Oaxaca, for sparkling wine from Spain, for these children who
show up in our dreams and want to live at any cost because life says
we are here to feed them joy. Your soul so finely woven the silkworms went
on strike, said the mulberry tree. We all have mulberry trees in the memory
yard. They hold the place for skinned knees earned by small braveries,
cousins you love who are gone. All memory bends to fit. We become poems.
BEYOND
Beyond sunrise, there is a song we follow
Beyond clouds traveling with rain humped
On their backs, lightning in their fists
Beyond the blue horizon where our ancestors
Appear bearing gifts, wrapped in blankets woven
With sun and strands of scarlet time
Beyond the footpaths we walk every day
From sunrise to kitchen, to work, to garden, to play
To sunset, to dark, and back
Beyond where the baby sleeps, her breath
A light mist of happiness making
A fine rainbow of becoming knowledgeable around us
Beyond the children learning alphabets
And numbers, bent over their sticks and dolls
As they play war and family, grow human paths
Beyond the grandmothers and grandfathers
Their mothers and fathers, and in the marrow of their bones
To when that song was first sung we traveled on
Beyond sunset, can you hear it?
The shaking of shells, the drumming of feet, the singers
Singing, all of us, all at once?
In the song of beyond, how deep we are—

MEMORY SACK
That first cry opens the earth door.
We join the ancestor road.
With our pack of memories
Slung slack on our backs
We venture into the circle
Of destruction,
Which is the circle
Of creation
And make more—
Every night during the summer and into early fall here in the homelands, there
is a huge concert of the insect orchestra. Now the orchestra is shutting down
for the season. Last night I heard two or three stragglers trying to carry on a
song. They reminded me of the last remaining souls at a forty-nine dance,
bleary-eyed, dragging blankets, and still singing though everyone else has
gone home.
CEHOTOSAKVTES
It is said that two beloved women sang this song as their band came over on
the Trail of Tears. One woman walked near the front of the people, and the
other walked near the back with the small children. When anyone faltered,
they would sing this song to hold them up.

Do not get tired.
Don’t be discouraged. Be determined.
Come. Together let’s go toward the highest place.
One March a few years back, I was in residence at a private women’s
college in Atlanta. I’d heard of a gathering to be held at the Battle of
Horseshoe Bend grounds, which is not far from Opelika, Alabama. Many
from our Muscogee Creek Nation were being bused in from Oklahoma. I
wanted to see family and friends, and to once again visit homeland territory. I
took a few students with me. It was a strange set of events, positioned on the
anniversary of the battle which was essentially a massacre. We Mvskoke
citizens came to acknowledge that we are very present in the continuum of
time, and to give honor to our ancestors. That battle did not destroy us. We
tribal descendants danced, spoke, visited, and some people had booths
demonstrating culture and arts. Euro-American reenactors and descendants
dressed up in military uniforms, paraded guns and shot off cannons. They
were preparing for a reenactment of the killing. Late afternoon I drove the
students back to their campus in Atlanta. They quickly dozed in the backseat
as I wound through the back roads to catch the main highway to Atlanta. I
noted a sign “90 miles to Atlanta.” Then I heard the rhythm sound of a
running horse coming up behind me. I smelled the sweat of human and horse,
and as the breathy team caught up I saw my grandfather astride the horse.
What a rider he was, just as I had been told in all the stories. I remembered
that my aunt Lois Harjo told me how Monahwee could bend time. He could
arrive at a destination on horseback long before it was physically possible.
And as quickly as he’d come, he was gone, and I saw a traffic sign “30 miles
to Atlanta.” I’d only been on that road for a few minutes. My grandfather had
come back to show me how he folded time. The Old Ones will always tell
you, your ancestors keep watch over you. Listen to them.
BY THE WAY
for Adrienne Rich
I’ve given it time, as if time were mine to give.
There was a dam, larger than Hoover or the president or the patent
For the metal creature that sucks up all the dust.
Words had to stop and ask permission before crossing over.
Oh, sometimes they were wild with the urgency of sweet
And leaped—
Mostly the rest were kept in the net
Of swallowed, or forbidden language.
I want to go back and rewrite all the letters.
I lied frequently.
No. I was not okay.
And neither was James Baldwin though his essays
Were perfect spinning platters of comprehension of the fight
To assert humanness in a black and white world.
That’s how blues emerged, by the way—
Our spirits needed a way to dance through the heavy mess.
The music, a sack that carries the bones of those left alongside
The trail of tears when we were forced
To leave everything we knew by the way—
I constructed an individual life in the so-called civilized world.
We all did—far from the trees and plants
Who had born us and fed us.
All I wanted was the music, I would tell you now—
Within it, what we cannot carry.
I talk about then from a hotel room just miles
From your home in the east
Before you fled on your personal path of tears
To the west, that worn-out American Dream
Dogging your steps.
You lived on a pedestal for me then, the driven diver who climbed
Back up from the abyss, Venus on a seashell with a dagger
In her hands.
I had to look, and followed your tracks in the poems
Cut by suffering.
Aren’t they all?
We’re in the apocalyptic age of addiction and forgetting.
It’s worse now.
But that dam, I had to tell you. I broke it open stone by stone.
It took a saxophone, flowers, and your words
Had something to do with it
I can’t say exactly how.
The trajectory wasn’t clean even though it was sure.
Does that make sense?
Maybe it does only in the precincts of dreams and poetry,
Not in a country lit for twenty-four hours a day to keep dreams stuck
Turning in a wheel
In the houses of money.
I read about transcendence, how the light
Came in through the window of a nearby traveler
And every cell of creation opened its mouth
To drink grace
That’s what I never told you.
When we made it down last year to the Chattahoochee River dividing
Columbus and Phenix, to the Tie Snake place in the river, to the place women
sang, joked and gossiped as we washed clothes, to the old tribal town sites,
to where even one of our stolen houses belonging to an uncle was still
standing . . .
No one had told us how beautiful it was:
the waters of this river, these healing plants, these stones, these winds
roaming through on sunlight and rains, all the suns of our lost days.
They couldn’t remember because to remember would have killed us when
nothing else did.

AN AMERICAN SUNRISE
We were running out of breath, as we ran out to meet ourselves, We
Were surfacing the edge of our ancestors’ fights, and ready to Strike
It was difficult to lose days in the Indian bar if you were Straight.
Easy if you played pool and drank to remember to forget. We
Made plans to be professional—and did. And some of us could Sing
When we drove to the edge of the mountains, with a drum. We
Made sense of our beautiful crazed lives under the starry stars. Sin
Was invented by the Christians, as was the Devil, we sang. We
Were the heathens, but needed to be saved from them: Thin
Chance. We knew we were all related in this story, a little Gin
Will clarify the dark, and make us all feel like dancing. We
Had something to do with the origins of blues and jazz
I argued with the music as I filled the jukebox with dimes in June,
Forty years later and we still want justice. We are still America. We.
BLESS THIS LAND
Bless this land from the top of its head to the bottom of its feet
From the arctic old white head to the brown feet of tropical rain
Bless the eyes of this land, for they witness cruelty and kindness in this land
From sunrise light upright to falling down on your knees night
Bless the ears of this land, for they hear cries of heartbreak and shouts of
celebration in this land
Once we heard no gunshot on these lands; the trees and stones can
be heard singing
Bless the mouth, lips and speech of this land, for the land is a speaker, a
singer, a keeper of all that happens here, on this land
Luminous forests, oceans, and rock cliff sold for the trash glut of
gold, uranium, or oil bust rush yet there are new stories to be made,
little ones coming up over the horizon
Bless the arms and hands of this land, for they remake and restore beauty in
this land
We were held in the circle around these lands by song, and
reminded by the knowers that not one is over the other, no human
above the bird, no bird above the insect, no wind above the grass
Bless the heart of this land on its knees planting food beneath the eternal
circle of breathing, swimming and walking this land
The heart is a poetry maker. There is one heart, said the poetry
maker, one body and all poems make one poem and we do not use
words to make war on this land
Bless the gut labyrinth of this land, for it is the center of unknowing in this
land
Bless the femaleness and maleness of this land, for each holds the fluent
power of becoming in this land
When it was decided to be in this manner here in this place, this
land, all the birds made a birdly racket from indigo sky holds
Bless the two legs and two feet of this land, for the sacred always walks
beside the profane in this land
These words walk the backbone of this land, massaging the tissue
around the cord of life, which is the tree of life, upon which this
land stands
Bless the destruction of this land, for new shoots will rise up from fire,
floods, earthquakes and fierce winds to make new this land
We are land on turtle’s back—when the weight of greed overturns
us, who will recall the upright song of this land
Bless the creation of new land, for out of chaos we will be compelled to
remember to bless this land
The smallest one remembered, the most humble one, the one whose
voice you’d have to lean in a thousand years to hear—we will begin
there
Bless us, these lands, said the rememberer. These lands aren’t our lands.
These lands aren’t your lands. We are this land.
And the blessing began a graceful moving through the grasses of
time, from the beginning, to the circling around place of time,
always moving, always
Things take the time they take. Don’t
worry.
How many roads did St. Augustine follow
before he became St. Augustine?
Walking to Indian River
I’m ready for spring, but it hasn’t arrived.
Not yet.
Still I take my walk, looking for any
early enhancements.
It’s mostly attitude. I’m certain
I’ll see something.
I start down the path, peering in
all directions.
The mangroves, as always, are standing in their
beloved water,
their new leaves very small and tender
and pale.
And, look! the way the rising sun
strikes them,
they could be flowers
opening!
Roses
Everyone now and again wonders about
those questions that have no ready
answers: first cause, God’s existence,
what happens when the curtain goes
down and nothing stops it, not kissing,
not going to the mall, not the Super
Bowl.
“Wild roses,” I said to them one morning.
“Do you have the answers? And if you do,
would you tell me?”
The roses laughed softly. “Forgive us,”
they said. “But as you can see, we are
just now entirely busy being roses.”
Moments
There are moments that cry out to be fulfilled.
Like, telling someone you love them.
Or giving your money away, all of it.
Your heart is beating, isn’t it?
You’re not in chains, are you?
There is nothing more pathetic than caution
when headlong might save a life,
even, possibly, your own.
The World I Live In
I have refused to live
locked in the orderly house of
reasons and proofs.
The world I live in and believe in
is wider than that. And anyway,
what’s wrong with Maybe?
You wouldn’t believe what once or
twice I have seen. I’ll just
tell you this:
only if there are angels in your head will you
ever, possibly, see one.
Do the Trees Speak?
Do the trees speak back to the wind
when the wind offers some invitational comment?
As some of us do, do they also talk to the sun?
I believe so, and if such belief need rest on
evidence, let me just say, Sometimes it’s
an earful.
But there’s more.
If you can hear the trees in their easy hours
of course you can also hear them later,
crying out at the sawmill.
I Am Pleased to Tell You
Mr. Death, I am pleased to tell you, there
are rifts in your long black coat. Today
Rumi (obit. 1273) came visiting, and not for
the first time. True he didn’t speak with
his tongue but from memory, and whether
he was short or tall I still don’t know.
But he was as real as the tree I was
under. Just because something’s physical
doesn’t mean it’s the greatest. He
offered a poem or two, then sauntered on.
I sat awhile feeling content and feeling
contentment in the tree also. Isn’t
everything in the world shared? And one
of the poems contained a tree, so of
course the tree felt included. That’s
Rumi, who has no trouble slipping out of
your long black coat, oh Mr. Death.
Leaves and Blossoms Along the Way
If you’re John Muir you want trees to
live among. If you’re Emily, a garden
will do.
Try to find the right place for yourself.
If you can’t find it, at least dream of it.
•
When one is alone and lonely, the body
gladly lingers in the wind or the rain,
or splashes into the cold river, or
pushes through the ice-crusted snow.
Anything that touches.
•
God, or the gods, are invisible, quite
understandable. But holiness is visible,
entirely.
•
Some words will never leave God’s mouth,
no matter how hard you listen.
•
In all the works of Beethoven, you will
not find a single lie.
•
All important ideas must include the trees,
the mountains, and the rivers.
•
To understand many things you must reach out
of your own condition.
•
For how many years did I wander slowly
through the forest. What wonder and
glory I would have missed had I ever been
in a hurry!
•
Beauty can both shout and whisper, and still
it explains nothing.
•
The point is, you’re you, and that’s for keeps.
I Wake Close to Morning
Why do people keep asking to see
God’s identity papers
when the darkness opening into morning
is more than enough?
Certainly any god might turn away in disgust.
Think of Sheba approaching
the kingdom of Solomon.
Do you think she had to ask,
“Is this the place?”
Meadowlark
Has anyone seen meadowlark?
I’ve been looking for probably
forty years now
unsuccessfully.
He used to live in the field
I crossed many a morning
heading to the woods,
truant again from school.
There were no meadowlarks in the school.
Which was a good enough reason for me
not to want to be there.
But now it’s more serious.
There is no field, neither have the woods survived.
So, where is meadowlark?
If anyone has seen him, please would you let me know
posthaste?
The Wildest Storm
Yesterday the wildest storm
I ever witnessed flew past
west to east, a shaggy
howling sky-beast
flinging hail even as lightning
printed out its sizzling
unreadable language
followed by truly terrible laughter.
But, no. Maybe it wasn’t laughter
but a reminder we need—
seemingly something to do with power.
What could it be? What could it be?
What do you think it could be?
Cobb Creek
It’s morning at the creek-edge
and the question is:
Shall I jump as usual and enjoy,
as I have hundreds of times,
the casual down-thrust of my legs
on the other side?
Certain facts are unavoidable, still
something in me
refuses to abdicate.
I don’t spend much time on it.
I jump
and for the first time in my seventy-seven years
I fall in.
What a beautiful splash!
Nothing Is Too Small Not to Be Wondered About
The cricket doesn’t wonder
if there’s a heaven
or, if there is, if there’s room for him.
It’s fall. Romance is over. Still, he sings.
If he can, he enters a house
through the tiniest crack under the door.
Then the house grows colder.
He sings slower and slower.
Then, nothing.
This must mean something, I don’t know what.
But certainly it doesn’t mean
he hasn’t been an excellent cricket
all his life.
Whistling Swans
Do you bow your head when you pray or do you look
up into that blue space?
Take your choice, prayers fly from all directions.
And don’t worry about what language you use,
God no doubt understands them all.
Even when the swans are flying north and making
such a ruckus of noise, God is surely listening
and understanding.
Rumi said, There is no proof of the soul.
But isn’t the return of spring and how it
springs up in our hearts a pretty good hint?
Yes, I know, God’s silence never breaks, but is
that really a problem?
There are thousands of voices, after all.
And furthermore, don’t you imagine (I just suggest it)
that the swans know about as much as we do about
the whole business?
So listen to them and watch them, singing as they fly.
Take from it what you can.
Storage
When I moved from one house to another
there were many things I had no room
for. What does one do? I rented a storage
space. And filled it. Years passed.
Occasionally I went there and looked in,
but nothing happened, not a single
twinge of the heart.
As I grew older the things I cared
about grew fewer, but were more
important. So one day I undid the lock
and called the trash man. He took
everything.
I felt like the little donkey when
his burden is finally lifted. Things!
Burn them, burn them! Make a beautiful
fire! More room in your heart for love,
for the trees! For the birds who own
nothing—the reason they can fly.
Humility
Poems arrive ready to begin.
Poets are only the transportation.
For Tom Shaw S.S.J.E. (1945–2014)
Where has this cold come from?
“It comes from the death of your friend.”
Will I always, from now on, be this cold?
“No, it will diminish. But always
it will be with you.”
What is the reason for it?
“Wasn’t your friendship always as beautiful
as a flame?”
That Tall Distance
That tall distance where
the clouds begin,
the forge that pounds out the lightning
and the black porch where the stars
are dressed in light
and arrangement is made for the moon’s path—
it’s these I think of now, after
a lifetime of goldfinches,
meandering streams,
lambs playing,
the passionate hands of the sun,
the coolness under the trees
talking leaf to leaf,
the foxes and the otters sliding on the snow,
the dolphins for whom no doubt
the seas were created,
the spray of swallows gathering in autumn—
after all of that
the tall distance is what I think of now.
This Morning
This morning the redbirds’ eggs
have hatched and already the chicks
are chirping for food. They don’t
know where it’s coming from, they
just keep shouting, “More! More!”
As to anything else, they haven’t
had a single thought. Their eyes
haven’t yet opened, they know nothing
about the sky that’s waiting. Or
the thousands, the millions of trees.
They don’t even know they have wings.
And just like that, like a simple
neighborhood event, a miracle is
taking place.
Love
“Someone who does not run
toward the allure of love
walks a road where nothing lives.”
RUMI
When Did It Happen?
When did it happen?
“It was a long time ago.”
Where did it happen?
“It was far away.”
No, tell. Where did it happen?
“In my heart.”
What is your heart doing now?
“Remembering. Remembering!”
The First Day
After you left
I jumped up and down,
I clapped my hands,
I stared into space.
In those days I was starving for happiness.
So, say it was both silly and serious.
Say it was the first warm sting of possibility.
Say I sensed the spreading warmth of joy.
I Know Someone
I know someone who kisses the way
a flower opens, but more rapidly.
Flowers are sweet. They have
short, beatific lives. They offer
much pleasure. There is
nothing in the world that can be said
against them.
Sad, isn’t it, that all they can kiss
is the air.
Yes, yes! We are the lucky ones.
No, I’d Never Been to This Country
No, I’d never been to this country
before. No, I didn’t know where the roads
would lead me. No, I didn’t intend to
turn back.
I Did Think, Let’s Go About This Slowly
I did think, let’s go about this slowly.
This is important. This should take
some really deep thought. We should take
small thoughtful steps.
But, bless us, we didn’t.
This and That
In this early dancing of a new day—
dogs leaping on the beach,
dolphins leaping not far from shore—
someone is bending over me,
is kissing me slowly.
How Do I Love You?
How do I love you?
Oh, this way and that way.
Oh, happily. Perhaps
I may elaborate by
demonstration? Like
this, and
like this and
no more words now
That Little Beast
That pretty little beast, a poem,
has a mind of its own.
Sometimes I want it to crave apples
but it wants red meat.
Sometimes I want to walk peacefully
on the shore
and it wants to take off all its clothes
and dive in.
Sometimes I want to use small words
and make them important
and it starts shouting the dictionary,
the opportunities.
Sometimes I want to sum up and give thanks,
putting things in order
and it starts dancing around the room
on its four furry legs, laughing
and calling me outrageous.
But sometimes, when I’m thinking about you,
and no doubt smiling,
it sits down quietly, one paw under its chin,
and just listens.
What This Is Not
This is not just surprise and pleasure.
This is not just beauty sometimes
too hot to touch.
This is not a blessing with a beginning
and an end.
This is not just a wild summer.
This is not conditional.
Everything That Was Broken
Everything that was broken has
forgotten its brokenness. I live
now in a sky-house, through every
window the sun. Also your presence.
Our touching, our stories. Earthy
and holy both. How can this be, but
it is. Every day has something in
it whose name is Forever.
Except for the Body
Except for the body
of someone you love,
including all its expressions
in privacy and in public,
trees, I think,
are the most beautiful
forms on the earth.
Though, admittedly,
if this were a contest,
the trees would come in
an extremely distant second.
Not Anyone Who Says
Not anyone who says, “I’m going to be
careful and smart in matters of love,”
who says, “I’m going to choose slowly,”
but only those lovers who didn’t choose at all
but were, as it were, chosen
by something invisible
and powerful and uncontrollable
and beautiful and possibly even
unsuitable—
only those know what I’m talking about
in this talking about love.
The Pond
August of another summer, and once again
I am drinking the sun
and the lilies again are spread across the water.
I know now what they want is to touch each other.
I have not been here for many years
during which time I kept living my life.
Like the heron, who can only croak, who wishes he could sing,
I wish I could sing.
A little thanks from every throat would be appropriate.
This is how it has been, and this is how it is:
All my life I have been able to feel happiness,
except whatever was not happiness,
which I also remember.
Each of us wears a shadow.
But just now it is summer again
and I am watching the lilies bow to each other,
then slide on the wind and the tug of desire,
close, close to one another.
Soon now, I’ll turn and start for home.
And who knows, maybe I’ll be singing.
Late Spring
Finally the world is beginning
to change, its fevers mounting,
its leaves unfolding.
And the mockingbirds find
ample reason and breath to fashion
new songs. They do. You can
count on it.
As for lovers, they are discovering
new ways to love. Listen, their windows are open.
You can hear them laughing.
Without spring who knows what would happen.
A lot of nothing, I suppose.
The leaves are all in motion now
the way a young boy rows and rows
in his wooden boat, just to get anywhere.
Late, late, but now lovely and lovelier.
And the two of us, together—a part of it.
A House, or a Million Dollars
People do it,
some out of desperation,
others out of greed.
They steal.
The very powerful and clever
might steal a whole house,
or a million dollars.
It’s been done.
But what does it matter?
Love is the one thing the heart craves
and love is the one thing
you can’t steal.
I Don’t Want to Lose
I don’t want to lose a single thread
from the intricate brocade of this happiness.
I want to remember everything.
Which is why I’m lying awake, sleepy
but not sleepy enough to give it up.
Just now, a moment from years ago:
the early morning light, the deft, sweet
gesture of your hand
reaching for me.
I Have Just Said
I have just said
something
ridiculous to you
and in response,
your glorious laughter.
These are the days
the sun
is swimming back
to the east
and the light on the water
gleams
as never, it seems, before.
I can’t remember
every spring,
I can’t remember
everything—
so many years!
Are the morning kisses
the sweetest
or the evenings
or the inbetweens?
All I know
is that “thank you” should appear
somewhere.
So, just in case
I can’t find
the perfect place—
“Thank you, thank you.”
The Gift
Be still, my soul, and steadfast.
Earth and heaven both are still watching
though time is draining from the clock
and your walk, that was confident and quick,
has become slow.
So, be slow if you must, but let
the heart still play its true part.
Love still as once you loved, deeply
and without patience. Let God and the world
know you are grateful.
That the gift has been given.
Felicity
“Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing
there is a field. I’ll meet you there.”
A Voice from I Don’t Know Where
It seems you love this world very much.
“Yes,” I said. “This beautiful world.”
And you don’t mind the mind, that keeps you
busy all the time with its dark and bright wonderings?
“No, I’m quite used to it. Busy, busy,
all the time.”
And you don’t mind living with those questions,
I mean the hard ones, that no one can answer?
“Actually, they’re the most interesting.”
And you have a person in your life whose hand
you like to hold?
“Yes, I do.”
It must surely, then, be very happy down there
in your heart.
“Yes,” I said. “It is.”
